    Hi Adam

We saw your Sales Account Executive role on LinkedIn at Kersheh Group and thought you might like that we can manage prospecting, cold calling and setting meetings across sleepwear channels so your team stays focused on closing national chain deals and executing account plans while cutting costs.

We provide prospecting and cold calling services with sleepwear account experience and North America wholesale chain outreach. We can set qualified meetings and manage incremental revenue campaigns so your team can focus on closing national chain deals on a lean cost model.

As the Vice President of Sales youâ€™re positioned to steer pipeline growth. I also sent a note to Bob Alen in case this is relevant to marketing. Our contracts are month to month with no commitment and we can work alongside existing agencies or internal teams.

Can we set up a call to introduce ourselves?
