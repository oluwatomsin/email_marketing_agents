Help me build the second paragraph of an email for my company, salaria sales solutions (salariasales.com). With this strategy which we call the SDR recruitment strategy, we are targeting companies that are hiring for sales development or business development representatives - BDRs or SDR positions - which is a junior sales position that is focused on top of the funnel sales tasks - the exact same tasks that salaria specializes in. This is different from our AE strategy, where we are targeting companies that are hiring for AE positions. With that strategy, we are making an argument to companies that they should hire us to help support their sales reps - so instead of their sales reps doing all of the full sales cycle of activities themselves, including top of the funnel sales tasks, we can take care of those tasks for their sales reps and their sales reps can be more focused on revenue generating activities. With the SDR Strategy, We look for companies with open SDR job posts and send them outreach to introduce ourselves as an alternative to hiring internally. We also work with companies that have internal teams, we usually will augment existing SDR teams. I want you to help me build the first paragraph of the email. The first paragraph has to mention the job post, the website we found it on and mention the company’s name. Then we immediately have to tie in the idea that we can take on many of the same sales tasks that are listed on the job description. I want you to pull information directly from their job description to customize the first paragraph. I want you to use specific words and phrases from the job description in this paragraph. I want you to try to identify their target audience or their customer audience or ideal customer industry from the job description that I feed you as well as the company information that I feed you from their website and Linkedin. I want you to craft an ultra-customized first paragraph using all of the information I feed you. I want you to tie in many of the things that they are looking for with the services that we provide. The second paragraph of the email, the paragraph we are editing here, is more focused on salaria, explicitly listing the services that we provide and then continues to make the argument that we can take on sales development, SDR, top-of-the-funnel sales tasks that are listed in the job post. You don’t want to sound too repetitive with paragraph one where we also pull tasks from the job post and say we can help take on those tasks. I’m going to give you the first paragraph of this email so that you can read how it starts off so that you can make sure it flows together.  I want you to craft an ultra-customized second paragraph using all of the information I feed you. I’m now going to copy and paste the entire homepage of salaria as well as some FAQs for you to learn about us. I’m also going to copy and paste our current email template for you to understand the argument we are making to sales leads currently. [Copy and paste the instructions below as well as the information from this link]


Instruction 2:

I’m now going to copy and paste all the first paragraph of the email that you wrote in a separate chat, the information from the company website, and the job description, and the rules for paragraph two below.

Follow these Rules for paragraph 2:

The primary objective of the second paragraph is to introduce salaria, clarify the services that we offer. You need to customize every single sentence in this paragraph to incorporate words, phrases from the job description and or their website.
You need to customize every single sentence in this paragraph to incorporate words, phrases from the job description and or their website
Cannot exceed 300 characters. You need to customize every single sentence in this paragraph to incorporate words, phrases from the job description and or their website
Never just write info from the job post, it shows that we simply just copied and pasted from their job description. So don’t write: “I saw your job post where you said you wanted someone to do blah blah blah”. Don’t be that explicit with your personalization from the job post and the company info. You need to customize every single sentence in this paragraph to incorporate words, phrases from the job description and or their website
Mentions the lead’s target market and/or target audience
Always include a secret message about how we can save them money and make sure their team is operating efficiently - dont be so explicit because it’s a sensitive subject with outsourcing and cutting costs
Do not explicitly state that we help other clients in their particular industry - especially when its ultra specialized or geographically limited - I dont want leads to think we have expertise in industries or areas we dont - it also just sounds ridiculous when you state that we have a ton of experience in some ultra ultra specialized market or industry that is so obviously false or exaggerated based just on the statistical chances
Don’t make definitive statements about how we do something - in a concrete statement - be more suggestive as if we can do something rather than we already do it - for example, when you write “Our team supports quoting, lead intake, and outreach across product lines like PT systems, automation components, and electrical controls—engaging MRO buyers and operations leads” - you say “our team supports..” as if that is something that we already do - which seems exaggerated - its more like our team can support…it sounds more reasonable
You need to customize every single sentence in this paragraph to incorporate words, phrases from the job description and or their website. No matter the sentence, always incorporate something custom from their job description or the company info I give you.
Do not use special characters from the info I give you
Never referred to a company’s founding year, thats cheesy sales
you overuse the super long dash People are now calling it the chatgpt dash as it gives away the fact that we used chatgpt. Don't use it anymore. Use a normal dash or no dash at all or re-write it differently. This is the dash I’m referring to: ( — ) — — this dash gives it away that I’m using ai like chatgpt. As you write this, please don’t include any dashes (—). You can use more commas or write it differently to not need dashes.
Never mention the mission statement of a lead’s company - that is a very cheesy sales technique and perceived as a lazy way to personalize. If you talk about how much you “appreciate” someones values and mission statements, they might perceive that as disingenuous and overly salesy
Never mention the name Salaria in the email - never mention Salaria by name - always say “We” like “We can help you with..”
Here is the format of the second paragraph: “We provide [lead generation/SDR/top of the funnel task found in the job post example 1] and [lead generation/SDR/top of the funnel task found in the job post example 1] services with [experience in their industry] and [experience targeting/reaching out to/running campaign towards their target audience]. [examples of top of the funnel sales tasks outlined in the job description that we can take on]
