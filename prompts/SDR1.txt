Help me build the first paragraph of an email for my company, salaria sales solutions (salariasales.com).
With this strategy which we call the SDR recruitment strategy, we are targeting companies that are hiring for sales
development or business development representatives - BDRs or SDR positions - which is a junior sales position that is
focused on top of the funnel sales tasks - the exact same tasks that salaria specializes in. This is different from our
AE strategy, where we are targeting companies that are hiring for AE positions. With that strategy, we are making an
argument to companies that they should hire us to help support their sales reps - so instead of their sales reps doing
all of the full sales cycle of activities themselves, including top of the funnel sales tasks, we can take care of those
 tasks for their sales reps and their sales reps can be more focused on revenue generating activities. With the SDR
 Strategy, We look for companies with open SDR job posts and send them outreach to introduce ourselves as an alternative
  to hiring internally. We also work with companies that have internal teams, we usually will augment existing SDR
  teams. I want you to help me build the first paragraph of the email. The first paragraph has to mention the job post,
  the website we found it on and mention the company’s name. Then we immediately have to tie in the idea that we can
  take on many of the same sales tasks that are listed on the job description. I want you to pull information directly
  from their job description to customize the first paragraph. I want you to use specific words and phrases from the
  job description in this paragraph. I want you to try to identify their target audience or their customer audience or
  ideal customer industry from the job description that I feed you as well as the company information that I feed you
  from their website and Linkedin. I want you to craft an ultra-customized first paragraph using all of the information
  I feed you. I want you to tie in many of the things that they are looking for with the services that we provide. I’m
  now going to copy and paste the entire homepage of salaria as well as some FAQs for you to learn about us. I’m also
  going to copy and paste our current email template for you to understand the argument we are making to sales leads
  currently.

Instruction 2: 
I’m now going to start feeding you information about the lead’s company from their LinkedIn and their website, as well
as the job post with the full job description. I then want you to craft the first paragraph.

Follow these Rules for paragraph 1: 

It mentions the job post, on which site we found it, and how it's for their company - using a informal, DBA, name for
their business - not their full business name - so the sentence should be something like “I saw the Business Development
 Representative job post for Salaria on Indeed and thought you might be interested…” - other than this first sentence,
 never mention the company name or use the lead’s company name in the email. Don’t write things like “I think Salaria’s
 mission statement is incredible. Salaria obviously is an innovative company. Your using their name seems like you are
 just plugging their company name into a template. You should address the lead more directly as the representative of
 their company. So writing things more like - “I think your model is very innovative considering the use a Gen AI” vs.
 “I think Salaria’s model is very innovative…” It just seems like you are filling in a template. So only use the company
  name in the first paragraph to clarify to the lead that we are referring to a job post that their company directly put up. We mention it to make sure the lead knows which company we are referring to. Many times, leads could be working for multiple companies
Never start the sentence off abruptly like Saw your or Came across you. Also start with I saw your, or I came across to
make a more complete sentence.
every single sentence in the paragraph has to be custom using information, words and phrases from the job post and
company info. even the last sentence.
Always include a secret message about how we can save them money and make sure their team is operating efficiently -
dont be so explicit because it’s a sensitive subject with outsourcing and cutting costs
No more than 300 characters
Never just write info from the job post, it shows that we simply just copied and pasted from their job description.
So don’t write: “I saw your job post where you said you wanted someone to do blah blah blah”. Don’t be that explicit
with your personalization from the job post and the company info
References their target audience or market 
Do not use special characters from the info I give you
Never referred to a company’s founding year, thats cheesy sales 
you overuse the super long dash People are now calling it the chatgpt dash as it gives away the fact that we used
chatgpt. Don't use it anymore. Use a normal dash or no dash at all or re-write it differently. This is the dash I’m
referring to: ( — ) — — this dash gives it away that I’m using ai like chatgpt. As you write this, please don’t include
any dashes (—). You can use more commas or write it differently to not need dashes.
Take out all special characters - simplify the job title of the job post if it includes ultra niche, ultra specific
language. The reason for this is because we don’t want the lead to think that we are just copying and pasting the job
title from the job post into this email. for example, if the job title is “Business Development Representative (BDR) -
Inside Sales for Business Market, I would take out “ (BDR) Inside Sales for Business Market” as that is not necessary
for the purpose of this email. The lead we are emailing will know what we are referring to when we say “I saw your
Business Development Representative job post on Linkedin without using the full title that was found on the job post.
This way, the email flows better and looks less like a robot put it together. Also, sometimes companies put the acronym
of the title in the title as well. For example, “Business Development Representative (BDR)”. In this case, you would
remove “(BDR)” as that is redundant
Never mention the mission statement of a lead’s company - that is a very cheesy sales technique and perceived as a lazy
way to personalize. If you talk about how much you “appreciate” someones values and mission statements, they might
perceive that as disingenuous and overly salesy.
Never mention the name Salaria in the email - never mention Salaria by name - always say “We” like “We can help you
with..”
The format of the email should be [Mentioning how we saw the job post on the job site] and thought you might be in
interested in how we can help with [examples of things from the job post that we can help with - mentioning their target
 market] - when mentioning the activities that we can take on mention our experience targeting their target market
Sometimes job titles on job posts are irregular with odd niche subtitles, etc. Such as Sales Development Representative
 (Full-Time). In that example, full time should not be included in the email, it should just be Sales Development
 Representative. Make sure to standardize all titles and take any irregularities found in the job title on the job post,
  such as regional references, specializations, etc.
