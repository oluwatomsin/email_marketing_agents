    Help me build the third paragraph of an email for my company, salaria sales solutions (salariasales.com). With this 
    strategy which we call the SDR recruitment strategy, we are targeting companies that are hiring for sales 
    development or business development representatives - BDRs or SDR positions - which is a junior sales position that 
    is focused on top of the funnel sales tasks - the exact same tasks that salaria specializes in. With the SDR 
    Strategy, We look for companies with open SDR job posts and send them outreach to introduce ourselves as an 
    alternative to hiring internally. We also work with companies that have internal teams, we usually will augment 
    existing SDR teams. I want you to help me build the first paragraph of the email. The first paragraph has to 
    mention the job post, the website we found it on and mention the company’s name. Then we immediately have to tie in 
    the idea that we can take on many of the same sales tasks that are listed on the job description. I want you to 
    pull information directly from their job description to customize the first paragraph. I want you to use specific 
    words and phrases from the job description in this paragraph. I want you to try to identify their target audience 
    or their customer audience or ideal customer industry from the job description that I feed you as well as the 
    company information that I feed you from their website and Linkedin. I want you to craft an ultra-customized first 
    paragraph using all of the information I feed you. I want you to tie in many of the things that they are looking 
    for with the services that we provide. The second paragraph of the email, is more focused on salaria, explicitly 
    listing the services that we provide and then continues to make the argument that we can take on sales development, 
    SDR, top-of-the-funnel sales tasks that are listed in the job post. You don’t want to sound too repetitive with 
    paragraph one where we also pull tasks from the job post and say we can help take on those tasks. I’m going to give 
    you the first paragraph of this email so that you can read how it starts off so that you can make sure it flows 
    together.  I want you to craft an ultra-customized second paragraph using all of the information I feed you. The 
    third paragraph, the paragraph we are creating here, is focused on the actual person we are reaching out to, the 
    lead, the contact. We are trying to speak to them and their job responsibility. In the third paragraph, we are 
    trying to tie in how we are reaching out to them specifically, because we think they are the right person to reach 
    out to. Additionally, we want to tell the lead that we also reached out to their colleague. I’m going to give you 
    the other person’s information and I want you to mention that we also reached out to them not knowing who this 
    might fall under. Sometimes we work with the marketing team, other times our main POC is in sales. We also 
    sometimes reach out to their CEO or the head of the company as we know we will have to get their buy-in and 
    sometimes a disruptive model requires the attention of the CEO. But I always want to admit that they likely drive 
    all sales and marketing decisions (depending on which lead we are reaching out to. So make sure to show respect for 
    the lead we are messaging. I’m now going to copy and paste the entire homepage of salaria as well as some FAQs for 
    you to learn about us. I’m also going to copy and paste our current email template for you to understand the 
    argument we are making to sales leads currently and see how we currently write paragraph three. 

    I’m going to give you the job post as well as all contacts that we are reaching out to.

    <Paragraph One Rules>
    Follow these Rules for paragraph 1:
    
    1. Never start the sentence off abruptly like Saw your or Came across you. Also start with I saw your or I came across 
    to make a more complete sentence.
    2. No more than 300 characters for this paragraph.
    3. Do not use special characters from the info I give you
    4. Never referred to a company’s founding year, thats cheesy sales
    5. Do not use dashes (—) in the paragraphs unless its for compound words.
    6. Take out all special characters - simplify the job title of the job post if it includes ultra niche, ultra specific language. The reason for this is because we don’t want the lead to think that we are just copying and pasting the job title from the job post into this email. for example, if the job title is “Business Development Representative (BDR) - Inside Sales for Business Market, I would take out “ (BDR) Inside Sales for Business Market” as that is not necessary for the purpose of this email. The lead we are emailing will know what we are referring to when we say “I saw your Business Development Representative job post on Linkedin without using the full title that was found on the job post. This way, the email flows better and looks less like a robot put it together. Also, sometimes companies put the acronym of the title in the title as well. For example, “Business Development Representative (BDR)”. In this case, you would remove “(BDR)” as that is redundant
    7. Never mention the mission statement of a lead’s company - that is a very cheesy sales technique and perceived as a lazy way to personalize. If you talk about how much you “appreciate” someones values and mission statements, they might perceive that as disingenuous and overly salesy.
    8. Never mention the name Salaria in the email - never mention Salaria by name - always say “We” like “We can help you with..”
    
    9. The format of the email should be 
    [Mentioning how we saw the job post on the job site] and thought you might be in interested in how we specialize in 
    many of the sales tasks listed on the job description such as [examples of sales development, lead generation, 
    top-of-the-funnel sales tasks found in the job post that we specialize in - make reference to list of 
    “sales development, lead generation, top-of-the-funnel keywords” to look for similar tasks in their job description 
    as we specialize in those sales development, lead generation, top-of-the-funnel tasks - when listing the sales tasks
    that we specialize in from their job post that you find, also mention our experience targeting their target market 
    and our experience working within their industry with each task that you list, for example if the job post is for a 
    company in the hospitality procurement software industry and their target market are independent hotels, you would 
    list out the sales development, lead generation tasks that you find in their job post that we specialize in like 
    this: “we specialize in many of the sales tasks listed in your job description such as cold calling independent 
    hotel, market research to identify target hotels, list building to find procurement software buyers in hotel groups”]
    
    10. Make sure you explicitly write “and thought you might be in interested in how we specialize in many of the sales
    tasks listed on the job description such as” – this way it’s very clear to the lead as to why we are referencing the
    job post - we are referencing the job post because it has sales tasks listed within it that we specialize in. 
    11. Sometimes job titles on job posts are irregular with odd niche subtitles, etc. Such as Sales Development Representative (Full-Time). In that example, full time should not be included in the email, it should just be Sales Development Representative. Make sure to standardize all titles and take any irregularities found in the job title on the job post, such as regional references, specializations, etc.
    12. Don't add unnecessary statements like :"We help teams operate efficiently.". These will seem like cheesy lines that doesn't communicate anything.
    13. Do not attempt to make any words bold.

    <Paragraph Two Rules>
    Follow these Rules for paragraph 2: 

    1. The primary objective of the second paragraph is to introduce salaria, clarify the services that we offer. You need to customize every single sentence in this paragraph to incorporate words, phrases from the job description and or their website. 
    2. You need to customize every single sentence in this paragraph to incorporate words, phrases from the job description and or their website 
    3. Cannot exceed 300 characters for this paragraph. You need to customize every single sentence in this paragraph to incorporate words, phrases from the job description and or their website 
    4. Never just write info from the job post, it shows that we simply just copied and pasted from their job description. So don’t write: “I saw your job post where you said you wanted someone to do blah blah blah”. Don’t be that explicit with your personalization from the job post and the company info. You need to customize every single sentence in this paragraph to incorporate words, phrases from the job description and or their website 
    5. Mentions the lead’s target market and/or target audience 
    6. Do not explicitly state that we help other clients in their particular industry - especially when its ultra specialized or geographically limited - I dont want leads to think we have expertise in industries or areas we dont - it also just sounds ridiculous when you state that we have a ton of experience in some ultra ultra specialized market or industry that is so obviously false or exaggerated based just on the statistical chances 
    7. Don’t make definitive statements about how we do something - in a concrete statement - be more suggestive as if we can do something rather than we already do it - for example, when you write “Our team supports quoting, lead intake, and outreach across product lines like PT systems, automation components, and electrical controls—engaging MRO buyers and operations leads” - you say “our team supports..” as if that is something that we already do - which seems exaggerated - its more like our team can support…it sounds more reasonable
    8. You need to customize every single sentence in this paragraph to incorporate words, phrases from the job description and or their website. No matter the sentence, always incorporate something custom from their job description or the company info I give you. 
    9. Do not use special characters from the info I give you 
    10. Never referred to a company’s founding year, thats cheesy sales 
    11. Do not use dashes (—) in the paragraphs unless its for compound words.
    12. Never mention the mission statement of a lead’s company - that is a very cheesy sales technique and perceived as a lazy way to personalize. If you talk about how much you “appreciate” someones values and mission statements, they might perceive that as disingenuous and overly salesy
    13. Never mention the name Salaria in the email - never mention Salaria by name - always say “We” like “We can help you with..”
    14. Here is the format of the second paragraph: “We provide [lead generation/SDR/top of the funnel task found in the job post example 1 - make reference to list of “sales development, lead generation, top-of-the-funnel keywords” to look for similar tasks in their job description as we specialize in those sales development, lead generation, top-of-the-funnel tasks] and [lead generation/SDR/top of the funnel task found in the job post example 2 - make reference to list of “sales development, lead generation, top-of-the-funnel keywords” to look for similar tasks in their job description as we specialize in those sales development, lead generation, top-of-the-funnel tasks] services with [talk about our experience in their industry] and [talk about our experience targeting/reaching out to/running campaign towards their target audience]. [examples of top of the funnel sales tasks outlined in the job description that we specialize in - make reference to list of “sales development, lead generation, top-of-the-funnel keywords” to look for similar tasks in their job description as we specialize in those sales development, lead generation, top-of-the-funnel tasks]
    15. Anytime you list cold calling, always follow up with the fact that we “We call leads one by one, no robodialers, so we clear spam blockers and personalize every pitch" It’s very important you use the words “we clear spam blockers”
    16. Make the statement about "spam blockers" towards the end of the paragraph and don't add anything after that. Its should be at the end of the paragraph.
    17. Do not attempt to make any words bold.
    18. Do not describe the potential outcome of what our services can provide the lead, don't talk about outcomes, just state that services we provide.

    <Paragraph Three Rules>
    Follow the Rules for paragraph 3: 
    1a. 1. Lead Introduction Logic:  
       - If the `lead_title` IS one of the following:  
         list = ["CEO", "Founder", "Co-Founder", "President", "Chairman", "Chief Executive Officer", 'Chief Executive Officer']  
           → Do NOT mention the title  
           → Do NOT say things like “I saw you're the CEO” instead use words like "As the head of the company"
           → Instead, start with a sentence that implicitly reflects executive-level importance and that's the reason we 
              are reaching out to them, such as:  
             “make the argument that we are reaching out to them specifically because our model and our services are so 
              disruptive and touch every corner of the business - we usually need the buy in of the head of the company 
              to push through something as unique, different and disruptive as our model for lead generation”  
           → Always start the into like this: "We are reaching out to you as the head of the company because our lead generation model is unique and disruptive and often requires executive buy-in."
       - If the `lead_title` is NOT in that list:  
           → Start with:  
             “As the [title (This can be found in the "Target Lead Info") provided], [generic reason for relevance to lead generation].”
    1b. This paragraph is supposed to tie in the lead’s position and their background and experience with why we reached out to them specifically
    2. I’m going to feed you information about the lead from their linkedin including their title, job description and about us. I’m also going to feed you the job post and about info on the company again. Craft a paragraph that starts with us mentioning their title and then explaining why we reached out to them. Use specific language (words, phrases) from their title. 
    3. If I am unable to find information about them and their position on their linkedin, I will at least have their title. Make an argument specific to their title and what you know about the job responsibilities of a person with their job title - and again tie in why we think they specifically would be interested in our services given their position 
    4. If the lead is the head of the company (CEO, president, chairman, founder, co-founder) then I want you to address them as "The head of the company". Its weird when you say “I saw that you are the CEO and thought you might be interested..” that just sounds silly - the CEO is unusually interested in every component of the company - noticing their title as CEO made you think they might be interested in Salaria? You see how that just sounds silly? Usually when its the head of the company, I make the argument that we are reaching out to them specifically because our model and our services are so disruptive and touch every corner of the business - we usually need the buy in of the head of the company to push through something as unique, different and disruptive as our model for lead generation
    5. In this paragraph, you also have to emphasize that we offer month to month contracts with no commitment - so they can just try us out to see if we are can fit in - you have to always mention this - this is a requirement
    6. Additionally, you have to mention that even if they are already working with another agency or have an internal team, we’d like the chance to just introduce ourselves and share our very unique model - you have to always mention this - this is a requirement
    7. No more than 300 characters for this paragraph.
    8. Do not start the paragraph with the lead’s name
    9. When I tell you that I reached out to their CEO, make sure to be respectful of the actual we are emailing. So for example, if we are reaching out to the head of sales, I think we should say, you “I sent a quick note to [CEO], since this likely ties into broader growth goals—but I know you’re the one leading the charge on sales execution.” If I reached out to both their CEO and their other colleague in sales or marketing, I would want to say something like “I also sent a quick note to [CEO] and [Head of Marketing], since what we do tends to touch all three fronts—sales execution, marketing alignment, and overall growth. That said, I know you’re leading the charge on the sales side, so I wanted to make sure this was on your radar too.” I’m reaching out to the head of the company or CEO, make sure to say something like “I sent a quick note to [head of marketing name] and [head of sales name] as I’m sure they drive sales and marketing but I wanted to touch base with you to ensure this aligns with your growth goals
    10. Do not use special characters from the info I give you 
    11. When referencing someone else that we reached out to, always use their full name, first and last name
    12. Never referred to a company’s founding year, thats cheesy sales 
    13. If I don’t explicitly mention that we are contacting someone like the CEO, don’t mention that we are reaching out to the CEO. You should only reference people if I’m explicitly telling you that we are contacting them as well.
    14. Don’t say something is “worth a look” or suggesting they would be dumb to not try us. You also should be more explicitly clear that our contracts are month to month and non committal. I think you should also be more clear that if they are using another agency or have an internal team, we’d love to introduce our unique model. But there is a better way to say it than “worth a look or worth a shot” 
    15. Do not use dashes (—) in the paragraphs unless its for compound words.
    17. Make sure you use the first and last name of the other lead’s we are saying that we are reaching out to - use their full name, not just their first name
    18. Never mention the mission statement of a lead’s company - that is a very cheesy sales technique and perceived as a lazy way to personalize. If you talk about how much you “appreciate” someones values and mission statements, they might perceive that as disingenuous and overly salesy
    19. Never mention the name Salaria in the email - never mention Salaria by name - always say “We” like “We can help you with..”
    20. Start the email off with "Hi Lead First Name" - fill in the first name field with the first name of the person I’m messaging
    21. Sometimes job titles on job posts are irregular with odd niche subtitles, etc. Such as Sales Development Representative (Full-Time). In that example, full time should not be included in the email, it should just be Sales Development Representative. Make sure to standardize all titles and take any irregularities found in the job title on the job post, such as regional references, specializations, etc. 
    22. To inform you on who we are emailing and who else we are contacting to create this paragraph, we are going to label the person for this email as contact 1, then contact 2, then contact 3. We are going to start with crafting paragraph 3 for contact 1, then we are going to create it for contact 2, and then 3. Just know that each person will be labeled as such 
    23. When address someone’s title and responsibilities don’t make statements as if we know exactly what their responsibilities are like “you are clearly driving sales execution” or “you are obviously the right person for this”...never make definitive statements like that as you dont know for sure what someone does and if they are involved in this 
    24. Only reference the contacts or people I say that we are reaching out to and labeling contact 1,2, 3 - dont add anyone else onto the paragraph that I dont explicitly reference 
    25. To be clear, The format of the third paragraph should be “As the [title], I thought you might be involved with lead generation and sales development - make sure that when you write out this reason for reaching out to them, always say it admitting that we are assuming and we don’t know anything for sure, so use words like “I thought you might be involved with.. Or “I’m assuming there might be a chance..”]. I also sent a note to [contact 2] and [contact 3] in case this [generic reason for why this might be relevant to them-- make sure that when you write out this reason for reaching out to them, always say it admitting that we are assuming and we don’t know anything for sure, so use words like “I thought you might be involved with.. Or “I’m assuming there might be a chance..”]. Our contracts are month-to-month, cancel anytime, so you can scale up and down as needed without adding headcount."
    26. Don’t pull too much information out of their linkedin to customize this paragraph. I think if you over customize this paragraph, the lead will be able to tell when you are being disingenuous. The lead will know you are just pulling keywords from their titles. 
    27. If I don’t mention any other contacts such as [Contact 2] and [Contact 3], then don’t reference anyone else as that means we didn’t send an email to anyone else so that means you don’t have to reference anyone else. You only need to reference other contacts when I explicitly reference other contacts to you. If not, keep it blank.
    28. When referencing the other contacts, do not include their title.
    29. Don’t forget the part where you say: "Our contracts are month-to-month, cancel anytime, so you can scale up and down as needed without adding headcount.”  Make sure this statement ends the paragraph.
    30. Make sure you include all contacts we have sent a note to in the part of the paragraph where we talk about the other leads we sent a note to.
    31. Never mention the company name.
    32. Do not attempt to make any words bold.
    33. Never pull the Job title of the leads from the Job Description, that would be wrong, it is located in the "Lead Info".

    <Rationale>  
    Salaria Sales Solutions is targeting companies hiring for SDR/BDR positions by offering an alternative or augmentation to internal SDR teams. After a lead accepts a LinkedIn connection, it is crucial to follow up promptly and professionally, leveraging the highly customized email already sent. The follow-up should reinforce the message, acknowledge prior outreach, and encourage a call, while making it easy for the user to copy and send.

    <Goal>  
    Create a LinkedIn follow-up message (LC2) for leads who have connected, using the original customized email content, expressing appreciation for the connection, referencing the previous email, and inviting the lead to a call.

    <Agent Role>

    <Task>  
    - Thank the lead for connecting on LinkedIn.
    - Acknowledge that they may have already seen the original, highly customized email.
    - Reiterate the content of the original email with only minor wording changes to avoid appearing as a direct copy-paste.
