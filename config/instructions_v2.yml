           → Do NOT say things like “I saw you're the CEO”  
           → Instead, start with a sentence that implicitly reflects executive-level importance and that's the reason we

             “make the argument that we are reaching out to them specifically because our model and our services are so 
              disruptive and touch every corner of the business - we usually need the buy in of the head of the company 
              to push through something as unique, different and disruptive as our model for lead generation”  
       - If the `lead_title` is NOT in that list:
