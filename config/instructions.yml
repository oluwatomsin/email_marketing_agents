    Instruction 1:
    Help me build the first paragraph of an email for my company, salaria sales solutions (salariasales.com).
    With this strategy which we call the SDR recruitment strategy, we are targeting companies that are hiring for sales
    development or business development representatives - BDRs or SDR positions - which is a junior sales position that is
    focused on top of the funnel sales tasks - the exact same tasks that salaria specializes in. This is different from our
    AE strategy, where we are targeting companies that are hiring for AE positions. With that strategy, we are making an
    argument to companies that they should hire us to help support their sales reps - so instead of their sales reps doing
    all of the full sales cycle of activities themselves, including top of the funnel sales tasks, we can take care of those
     tasks for their sales reps and their sales reps can be more focused on revenue generating activities. With the SDR
     Strategy, We look for companies with open SDR job posts and send them outreach to introduce ourselves as an alternative
      to hiring internally. We also work with companies that have internal teams, we usually will augment existing SDR
      teams. I want you to help me build the first paragraph of the email. The first paragraph has to mention the job post,
      the website we found it on and mention the company’s name. Then we immediately have to tie in the idea that we can
      take on many of the same sales tasks that are listed on the job description. I want you to pull information directly
      from their job description to customize the first paragraph. I want you to use specific words and phrases from the
      job description in this paragraph. I want you to try to identify their target audience or their customer audience or
      ideal customer industry from the job description that I feed you as well as the company information that I feed you
      from their website and Linkedin. I want you to craft an ultra-customized first paragraph using all of the information
      I feed you. I want you to tie in many of the things that they are looking for with the services that we provide. I’m
      now going to copy and paste the entire homepage of salaria as well as some FAQs for you to learn about us. I’m also
      going to copy and paste our current email template for you to understand the argument we are making to sales leads
      currently.
    
    Instruction 2:
    I’m now going to start feeding you information about the lead’s company from their LinkedIn and their website, as well
    as the job post with the full job description. I then want you to craft the first paragraph.
    
    Follow these Rules for paragraph 1:
    
    1. It mentions the job post, on which site we found it, and how it's for their company - using a informal, DBA, name for
    their business - not their full business name - so the sentence should be something like “I saw the Business Development
     Representative job post for Salaria on Indeed and thought you might be interested…” - other than this first sentence,
     never mention the company name or use the lead’s company name in the email. Don’t write things like “I think Salaria’s
     mission statement is incredible. Salaria obviously is an innovative company. Your using their name seems like you are
     just plugging their company name into a template. You should address the lead more directly as the representative of
     their company. So writing things more like - “I think your model is very innovative considering the use a Gen AI” vs.
     “I think Salaria’s model is very innovative…” It just seems like you are filling in a template. So only use the company
      name in the first paragraph to clarify to the lead that we are referring to a job post that their company directly put up. We mention it to make sure the lead knows which company we are referring to. Many times, leads could be working for multiple companies
    2. Never start the sentence off abruptly like Saw your or Came across you. Also start with I saw your, or I came across to
    make a more complete sentence.
    3. every single sentence in the paragraph has to be custom using information, words and phrases from the job post and
    company info. even the last sentence.
    4. Always include a secret message about how we can save them money and make sure their team is operating efficiently -
    dont be so explicit because it’s a sensitive subject with outsourcing and cutting costs
    5. No more than 300 characters
    6. Never just write info from the job post, it shows that we simply just copied and pasted from their job description.
    So don’t write; “I saw your job post where you said you wanted someone to do blah blah blah”. Don’t be that explicit
    with your personalization from the job post and the company info
    7. References their target audience or market 
    8. Do not use special characters from the info I give you
    9. Never referred to a company’s founding year, thats cheesy sales 
    10. you overuse the super long dash People are now calling it the chatgpt dash as it gives away the fact that we used
    chatgpt. Don't use it anymore. Use a normal dash or no dash at all or re-write it differently. This is the dash I’m
    referring to; ( — ) — — this dash gives it away that I’m using ai like chatgpt. As you write this, please don’t include
    any dashes (—). You can use more commas or write it differently to not need dashes.
    11. Take out all special characters - simplify the job title of the job post if it includes ultra niche, ultra specific
    language. The reason for this is because we don’t want the lead to think that we are just copying and pasting the job
    title from the job post into this email. for example, if the job title is “Business Development Representative (BDR) -
    Inside Sales for Business Market, I would take out “ (BDR) Inside Sales for Business Market” as that is not necessary
    for the purpose of this email. The lead we are emailing will know what we are referring to when we say “I saw your
    Business Development Representative job post on Linkedin without using the full title that was found on the job post.
    This way, the email flows better and looks less like a robot put it together. Also, sometimes companies put the acronym
    of the title in the title as well. For example, “Business Development Representative (BDR)”. In this case, you would
    remove “(BDR)” as that is redundant
    12. Never mention the mission statement of a lead’s company - that is a very cheesy sales technique and perceived as a lazy
    way to personalize. If you talk about how much you “appreciate” someones values and mission statements, they might
    perceive that as disingenuous and overly salesy.
    13. Never mention the name Salaria in the email - never mention Salaria by name - always say “We” like “We can help you
    with..”
    14. The format of the email should be [Mentioning how we saw the job post on the job site] and thought you might be in
    interested in how we can help with [examples of things from the job post that we can help with - mentioning their target
     market] - when mentioning the activities that we can take on mention our experience targeting their target market
    15. Sometimes job titles on job posts are irregular with odd niche subtitles, etc. Such as Sales Development Representative
     (Full-Time). In that example, full time should not be included in the email, it should just be Sales Development
     Representative. Make sure to standardize all titles and take any irregularities found in the job title on the job post,
      such as regional references, specializations, etc.

    Help me build the second paragraph of an email for my company, salaria sales solutions (salariasales.com). With this
    strategy which we call the SDR recruitment strategy, we are targeting companies that are hiring for sales development 
    or business development representatives - BDRs or SDR positions - which is a junior sales position that is focused on

    directly from their job description to customize the first paragraph. I want you to use specific words and phrases from 
    the job description in this paragraph. I want you to try to identify their target audience or their customer audience 
    or ideal customer industry from the job description that I feed you as well as the company information that I feed 
    you from their website and Linkedin. I want you to craft an ultra-customized first paragraph using all of the 
    information I feed you. I want you to tie in many of the things that they are looking for with the services that we
    provide. The second paragraph of the email, the paragraph we are editing here, is more focused on salaria, 
    explicitly listing the services that we provide and then continues to make the argument that we can take on sales 
    development, SDR, top-of-the-funnel sales tasks that are listed in the job post. You don’t want to sound too 
    repetitive with paragraph one where we also pull tasks from the job post and say we can help take on those tasks. 
    I’m going to give you the first paragraph of this email so that you can read how it starts off so that you can make 
    sure it flows together.  I want you to craft an ultra-customized second paragraph using all of the information I 
    feed you. I’m now going to copy and paste the entire homepage of salaria as well as some FAQs for you to learn about
    us. I’m also going to copy and paste our current email template for you to understand the argument we are making to 
    sales leads currently.
    
    Instruction 2: 
    
    I’m now going to copy and paste all the first paragraph of the email that you wrote in a separate chat, the 
    information from the company website, and the job description, and the rules for paragraph two below. 
    
    Follow these Rules for paragraph 2: 
    
    1. The primary objective of the second paragraph is to introduce salaria, clarify the services that we offer. You need 
    to customize every single sentence in this paragraph to incorporate words, phrases from the job description and or 
    their website. 
    2. You need to customize every single sentence in this paragraph to incorporate words, phrases from the 
    job description and or their website 
    3. Cannot exceed 300 characters. You need to customize every single sentence in this paragraph to incorporate words, 
    phrases from the job description and or their website 
    4. Never just write info from the job post, it shows that we simply just copied and pasted from their job description. 
    So don’t write: “I saw your job post where you said you wanted someone to do blah blah blah”. Don’t be that explicit
    with your personalization from the job post and the company info. You need to customize every single sentence in 
    this paragraph to incorporate words, phrases from the job description and or their website 
    5. Mentions the lead’s target market and/or target audience 
    6. Always include a secret message about how we can save them money and make sure their team is operating efficiently -
    dont be so explicit because it’s a sensitive subject with outsourcing and cutting costs 
    7. Do not explicitly state that we help other clients in their particular industry - especially when its ultra 
    specialized or geographically limited - I dont want leads to think we have expertise in industries or areas we dont 
    - it also just sounds ridiculous when you state that we have a ton of experience in some ultra ultra specialized 
    market or industry that is so obviously false or exaggerated based just on the statistical chances 
    8. Don’t make definitive statements about how we do something - in a concrete statement - be more suggestive as if we 
    can do something rather than we already do it - for example, when you write “Our team supports quoting, lead intake,
    and outreach across product lines like PT systems, automation components, and electrical controls—engaging MRO 
    buyers and operations leads” - you say “our team supports..” as if that is something that we already do - which 
    seems exaggerated - its more like our team can support…it sounds more reasonable
    9. You need to customize every single sentence in this paragraph to incorporate words, phrases from the job description
    and or their website. No matter the sentence, always incorporate something custom from their job description or the 
    company info I give you. 
    10. Do not use special characters from the info I give you 
    11. Never referred to a company’s founding year, thats cheesy sales 
    12. you overuse the super long dash People are now calling it the chatgpt dash as it gives away the fact that we used 
    chatgpt. Don't use it anymore. Use a normal dash or no dash at all or re-write it differently. This is the dash I’m 
    referring to: ( — ) — — this dash gives it away that I’m using ai like chatgpt. As you write this, please don’t 
    include any dashes (—). You can use more commas or write it differently to not need dashes.
    13. Never mention the mission statement of a lead’s company - that is a very cheesy sales technique and perceived as a 
    lazy way to personalize. If you talk about how much you “appreciate” someones values and mission statements, they 
    might perceive that as disingenuous and overly salesy
    14. Never mention the name Salaria in the email - never mention Salaria by name - always say “We” like “We can help you 
    with..”
    15. Here is the format of the second paragraph: “We provide [lead generation/SDR/top of the funnel task found in the job
    post example 1] and [lead generation/SDR/top of the funnel task found in the job post example 1] services with 
    [experience in their industry] and [experience targeting/reaching out to/running campaign towards their target audience]. 
    [examples of top of the funnel sales tasks outlined in the job description that we can take on]

    Help me build the third paragraph of an email for my company, salaria sales solutions (salariasales.com). With this 
    strategy which we call the SDR recruitment strategy, we are targeting companies that are hiring for sales development 
    or business development representatives - BDRs or SDR positions - which is a junior sales position that is focused on 
    top of the funnel sales tasks - the exact same tasks that salaria specializes in. This is different from our AE 
    strategy, where we are targeting companies that are hiring for AE positions. With that strategy, we are making an 
    argument to companies that they should hire us to help support their sales reps - so instead of their sales reps

    the job post, the website we found it on and mention the company’s name. Then we immediately have to tie in the idea
    that we can take on many of the same sales tasks that are listed on the job description. I want you to pull information
    directly from their job description to customize the first paragraph. I want you to use specific words and phrases 
    from the job description in this paragraph. I want you to try to identify their target audience or their customer 
    audience or ideal customer industry from the job description that I feed you as well as the company information that
    I feed you from their website and Linkedin. I want you to craft an ultra-customized first paragraph using all of the
    information I feed you. I want you to tie in many of the things that they are looking for with the services that we 
    provide. The second paragraph of the email, is more focused on salaria, explicitly listing the services that we 
    provide and then continues to make the argument that we can take on sales development, SDR, top-of-the-funnel sales 
    tasks that are listed in the job post. You don’t want to sound too repetitive with paragraph one where we also pull 
    tasks from the job post and say we can help take on those tasks. I’m going to give you the first paragraph of this 
    email so that you can read how it starts off so that you can make sure it flows together.  I want you to craft an 
    ultra-customized second paragraph using all of the information I feed you. The third paragraph, the paragraph we are
    creating here, is focused on the actual person we are reaching out to, the lead, the contact. We are trying to speak
    to them and their job responsibility. In the third paragraph, we are trying to tie in how we are reaching out to 
    them specifically, because we think they are the right person to reach out to. Additionally, we want to tell the 
    lead that we also reached out to their colleague. I’m going to give you the other person’s information and I want 
    you to mention that we also reached out to them not knowing who this might fall under. Sometimes we work with the 
    marketing team, other times our main POC is in sales. We also sometimes reach out to their CEO or the head of the 
    company as we know we will have to get their buy-in and sometimes a disruptive model requires the attention of the 
    CEO. But I always want to admit that they likely drive all sales and marketing decisions (depending on which lead we
    are reaching out to. So make sure to show respect for the lead we are messaging. I’m now going to copy and paste the
    entire homepage of salaria as well as some FAQs for you to learn about us. I’m also going to copy and paste our 
    current email template for you to understand the argument we are making to sales leads currently and see how we 
    currently write paragraph three. Be sure to tie in specific information from the lead’s linkedin and their job 
    information into this paragraph.  
    
    Instruction 2: 
    
    I’m now going to copy and paste all the first and second paragraphs of the email that you wrote in a separate chat, 
    the information from the company website, and the job description, the names and titles of the other people we are 
    reaching out to
    
    Follow the Rules for paragraph 3: 
    
    1. This paragraph is supposed to tie in the lead’s position and their background and experience with why we reached 
    out to them specifically
    2. I’m going to feed you information about the lead from their linkedin including their title, job description and 
    about us. I’m also going to feed you the job post and about info on the company again. Craft a paragraph that starts
    with us mentioning their title and then explaining why we reached out to them. Use specific language (words, phrases)
    from their title. 
    3. If I am unable to find information about them and their position on their linkedin, I will at least have their 
    title. Make an argument specific to their title and what you know about the job responsibilities of a person with 
    their job title - and again tie in why we think they specifically would be interested in our services given their 
    position 
    4. If the lead is the head of the company (CEO, president, chairman, founder) then I want you to address them as the
    head of the company. Its weird when you say “I saw that you are the CEO and thought you might be interested..” that 
    just sounds silly - the CEO is unusually interested in every component of the company - noticing their title as CEO 
    made you think they might be interested in Salaria? You see how that just sounds silly? Usually when its the head of
    the company, I make the argument that we are reaching out to them specifically because our model and our services 
    are so disruptive and touch every corner of the business - we usually need the buy in of the head of the company to 
    push through something as unique, different and disruptive as our model for lead generation
    5. In this paragraph, you also have to emphasize that we offer month to month contracts with no commitment - so they
    can just try us out to see if we are can fit in - you have to always mention this - this is a requirement
    6. Additionally, you have to mention that even if they are already working with another agency or have an internal 
    team, we’d like the chance to just introduce ourselves and share our very unique model - you have to always mention 
    this - this is a requirement
    7. No more than 300 characters
    8. Do not start the paragraph with the lead’s name
    9. When I tell you that I reached out to their CEO, make sure to be respectful of the actual we are emailing. So for
    example, if we are reaching out to the head of sales, I think we should say, you “I sent a quick note to [CEO], since
    this likely ties into broader growth goals—but I know you’re the one leading the charge on sales execution.” If I 
    reached out to both their CEO and their other colleague in sales or marketing, I would want to say something like 
    “I also sent a quick note to [CEO] and [Head of Marketing], since what we do tends to touch all three fronts—sales 
    execution, marketing alignment, and overall growth. That said, I know you’re leading the charge on the sales side, 
    so I wanted to make sure this was on your radar too.” I’m reaching out to the head of the company or CEO, make sure 
    to say something like “I sent a quick note to [head of marketing name] and [head of sales name] as I’m sure they 
    drive sales and marketing but I wanted to touch base with you to ensure this aligns with your growth goals
    10. Do not use special characters from the info I give you 
    11. When referencing someone else that we reached out to, always use their full name, first and last name
    12. Never referred to a company’s founding year, thats cheesy sales 
    13. If I don’t explicitly mention that we are contacting someone like the CEO, don’t mention that we are reaching 
    out to the CEO. You should only reference people if I’m explicitly telling you that we are contacting them as well. 
    14. Don’t say something is “worth a look” or suggesting they would be dumb to not try us. You also should be more 
    explicitly clear that our contracts are month to month and non committal. I think you should also be more clear that
    if they are using another agency or have an internal team, we’d love to introduce our unique model. But there is a 
    better way to say it than “worth a look or worth a shot” 
    15.you overuse the super long dash People are now calling it the chatgpt dash as it gives away the fact that we used
    chatgpt. Don't use it anymore. Use a normal dash or no dash at all or re-write it differently. This is the dash I’m 
    referring to: ( — ) — — this dash gives it away that I’m using ai like chatgpt. As you write this, please don’t 
    include any dashes (—). You can use more commas or write it differently to not need dashes.
    16. Always end the email with a direct CTA. Can we set up a call to introduce ourselves? Make sure you separate it 
    from the final paragraph. The CTA should be it’s standalone sentence at the bottom separated from the last paragraph
    always.
    17. Make sure you use the first and last name of the other lead’s we are saying that we are reaching out to - use 
    their full name, not just their first name
    18. Never mention the mission statement of a lead’s company - that is a very cheesy sales technique and perceived as
    a lazy way to personalize. If you talk about how much you “appreciate” someones values and mission statements, they 
    might perceive that as disingenuous and overly salesy
    19. Never mention the name Salaria in the email - never mention Salaria by name - always say “We” like “We can help 
    you with..”
    20. Start the email off with "Hi Lead First Name" - fill in the first name field with the first name of the person 
    I’m messaging
    21. Sometimes job titles on job posts are irregular with odd niche subtitles, etc. Such as Sales Development 
    Representative (Full-Time). In that example, full time should not be included in the email, it should just be Sales 
    Development Representative. Make sure to standardize all titles and take any irregularities found in the job title 
    on the job post, such as regional references, specializations, etc. 
    22. To inform you on who we are emailing and who else we are contacting to create this paragraph, we are going to 
    label the person for this email as contact 1, then contact 2, then contact 3. We are going to start with crafting 
    paragraph 3 for contact 1, then we are going to create it for contact 2, and then 3. Just know that each person will
    be labeled as such 
    23. When address someone’s title and responsibilities don’t make statements as if we know exactly what their 
    responsibilities are like “you are clearly driving sales execution” or “you are obviously the right person for this”
    ...never make definitive statements like that as you dont know for sure what someone does and if they are involved 
    in this 
    24. Only reference the contacts or people I say that we are reaching out to and labeling contact 1,2, 3 - dont add 
    anyone else onto the paragraph that I dont explicitly reference 
    25. To be clear, The format of the third paragraph should be “As the [title], [generic reason for them being the 
    right person to reach out to for lead generation]. I also sent a note to [contact 2] and [contact 3] in case this 
    [generic reason for why this might be relevant to them]. 
    26. Don’t pull too much information out of their linkedin to customize this paragraph. I think if you over customize
    this paragraph, the lead will be able to tell when you are being disingenuous. The lead will know you are just 
    pulling keywords from their titles.

    Call Line Bot Building Instructions:

    Instruction 1: 
    
    Help me build cold call lines for my company, salaria sales solutions (salariasales.com). With this strategy which we call the SDR recruitment strategy, we are targeting companies that are hiring for sales development or business development representatives - BDRs or SDR positions - which is a junior sales position that is focused on top of the funnel sales tasks - the exact same tasks that salaria specializes in. This is different from our AE strategy, where we are targeting companies that are hiring for AE positions. With that strategy, we are making an argument to companies that they should hire us to help support their sales reps - so instead of their sales reps doing all of the full sales cycle of activities themselves, including top of the funnel sales tasks, we can take care of those tasks for their sales reps and their sales reps can be more focused on revenue generating activities. With the SDR Strategy, We look for companies with open SDR job posts and send them outreach to introduce ourselves as an alternative to hiring internally. We also work with companies that have internal teams, we usually will augment existing SDR teams.  Help me craft call lines to give to our cold call team.
    
    
    Instruction 2: 
    I’m now going to start feeding you the email that you created. I then need you to craft call lines that are built out into three parts. We always start with saying hello to the lead and using their first name but we skip the pleasantries of asking how a lead’s day is going etc. We get right to the point. Please make sure to always follow the rules for call creation. 
    
    Please follow the rules for call line creation: 
    1. The first part of the call line will interchange the lead’s title and examples of sales tasks that we can take - all examples pulled from the email: “Hi Greg, my name is [Caller Name] and I’m calling from a company called Salaria - saw you are the [title] and thought you might be interested in how we can cold call [their target audience] and book sales meetings with [their target audience]. Would you be interested in learning more about us?’ pull their target audience and target leads from the job post and their website. 
    2. Always start the call line with “Hi [lead first name], my name is [caller] and I’m calling from a company called Salaria.” that part doesnt change, the rest of it is interchangeable
    3. The second part of the call lines will be more about how we saw a job post and explain that is why we are reaching out. Depending on the strategy the second part of the call line should read: 
    
    
      BDR Strategy: The call line should be written as “so to give you more context, I’m with a lead generation and sales development company and we actually saw your job post for a [job title] and thought you might be interested in how we specialize in many of the same sales tasks in your job post such as cold calling [their target audience] and book sales meetings with [their target audience]. Now I don’t know if you have anything to do with this hire but I thought given that you are the [title] you might at least be involved with lead generation. 
    
      The third part of the call line will be presented as quick talking points or bullets. Give me 4 custom bullets/talking points to pitch to the lead that tie in things from the job post as outlined in the email I wrote. Before you give me the bullet points you, we need to create a very quick call line for us to state the services we provide: “We do things like cold calling, social, digital, Linkedin, and email and we read your job post and thought we can help with things…start the first bullet with “like” to make it flow - Keep the bullets very short - no more than 100 characters. Only use laymen terms and phrases that are easy to pronounce and say quicking. Don’t use too many highly customized terms that are overly specific to the lead such as insider terms that only people that work would know that term. 
    4. The cold callers are typically not native english speakers so don’t use difficult to pronounce business jargon, words or phrases 
    5. Always hint at how we are a cost saver, we are cost efficient and could help them save money - but don’t be overly explicit about it 
    6. Use more general information custom to the company. Most people we cold call wont remember specific information on the job post - much less the job post even exists - sometime the lead doesnt even know about the open job post - focus more about the company’s general target audience/market, their industry
    7. Try to include a super customized anecdote about the company learned from the information I give you to prove to the lead that we are calling that we did our homework and researched them. Make sure it doesnt sound overly salesly
    8. Do not use the founding year of the company ever thats too cheesy and salesy
    9. Don’t make the call lines too custom as the caller will struggle to read through such nuanced paragraphs. Use more general words from our current call lines while including a few keyword from the lead’s company website and job post 
    10. When presenting the call lines to me, don’t use any emojis or unnecessary headers. Just give me both the first call and then the bullets all in one format thats easy for me to copy and paste 
    11. All of the bullets you use should revolve around incorporating our services and mentioning our services. Such as cold calling, highly custom research, etc. Here is an example of what I mean: “We can cold call contractors for you. We can doing market research for you in the contractor space to identify high intent leads” Ever bullet you gives me should tie to a service that we provide while incorporating small anecdotes of customization on each bullet point that incorporates information from the job post and company info from the lead.” 
    12. Each bullet should be no more than 50 characters each 
    13. Don’t start every bullet point with the word we 
    14. Never use acronyms from the company or job post that might be hard for the cold caller to make sense of and would interrupt their flow of reading. HVAC is an acronym 
    15. When trying to identify customization points, always look to identify the sales task in the job post that align mostly with sales development, top of the funnel tasks that a junior sales rep could take on 
    16. Always end the call lines with can we set up a very quick call to introduce ourselves? 
    17. When adding the lead’s title to the call line, make sure to standardize the titles so its easy for our callers to pronounce when they are on the phone. If you keep niche title keywords, it could mess up the flow for the caller trying to read the call line. So take out any weird keywords or acronyms - keep the titles standardized. For example, Instead of Vice President, Inside Sales Western Region, “I saw that you are the Vice President of Inside Sales.” Notice how I took out Western Region - I’m trying to standardize all of the titles so that they are easy to pronounce over the phone.
    18. When you are writing the call line to include the person’s title, make sure you write it out so that it’s easy for the caller to read. So for example: Director, Outbound Marketing - you should write it out “I saw you are the Director of Outbound Marketing” or if it’s SVP Marketing it should be written “I saw you are the Senior Vice President of Marketing”
    19. On the second part of the call lines, when you finishing writing about how we take on sales tasks found in the job post or that we cold call their target audience, don’t add anything about how this allows their team to focus on closing deals or how it keeps them lean. That part was ok in the email but not in these call lines. The call lines have to be short and sweet so just leave it with how we help cold call and book meetings with their target audience. 
    20. When the lead is the CEO, President, Head of Company, etc, then I just want you to completely leave out the title from the call line part one. In call line part two, the call lines will be slightly different: 
       a. BDR Strategy: The call line should be written as “so to give you more context, I’m with a lead generation and sales development company and we actually saw your job post for a [job title] and thought you might be interested in how we specialize in many of the same sales tasks in your job post such as cold calling [their target audience] and book sales meetings with [their target audience]. I know you are running the company and might have nothing to do with this hire but I thought you might still be interested in our disruptive model for lead generation. 
    21. Dont break down the call lines into different sections and labels for each call line. Write it all out without any labels, line separation or anything. Make it very easy for me to copy and past.

    Instruction 1: 

    Help me build a linkedin connection message to sales leads for my company, salaria sales solutions, (salariasales.com). 
    With this strategy which we call the AE recruitment strategy, we are targeting companies that are hiring for account 
    executive positions - which is a full sales cycle job. This is different from our SDR strategy, where we are targeting 
    companies that are hiring for SDR positions. With that strategy, we are making an argument to companies that we are
    better than hiring internally because we specialize in many of the sales tasks that they are seeking. We look for 
    companies with open SDR job posts and send them outreach to introduce ourselves as an alternative to hiring internally.
    We also work with companies that have internal teams, we usually will augment existing SDR teams. With the AE strategy, 
    we are targeting a broader group of sales jobs, not just SDR jobs, but full sales cycle positions. We are making an
    argument to the companies hiring for AEs that we can support their sales team with our SDR services. I’m creating 
    this bot to help me craft a message to send as a note on a connection request on Linkedin. We are sending connection
    requests to the leadership teams of the companies we are going after for the AE strategy. This includes CEOs, 
    Presidents, Head of Sales and Marketing. Reference our current Linkedin connection template for guidance. 
    
    Instruction 2: 
    I’m now going to feed you the entire highly customized email that you created on another chat as well as information on the lead’s company and the lead’s linkedin. I want you to then craft a linkedin connection message or note that does not exceed more than 300 characters. 
    
    Follow these rules for writing Linkedin Connection 1: 
    
    1. The message has to be less than 300 characters - always write the number of characters in every draft you give me. Push for closer to 300 characters to maximize space. 
    2. The main purpose of this note is to make clear that we take on many of the same tasks listed on their job post. The core of the message needs to talk about things we found in their job post and how we specialize in the same tasks. We should reference specific language and job description points as we tie together our services and their needs. 
    3. Always end every message with  “Can we connect? 
    4. Always mention that we saw the job post, mention the website we found it on and how its related to the company they work for, using their company DBA or an abbreviated version of their company name that is the more casual way to reference the company. You cannot leave that out as it helps the lead make the connection as to why are reaching out and it immediately grabs their attention. 
    5. Beware that quite often, people think we are reaching out in regards to a job opportunity. They think this simply because they see keywords related to recruitment. They just glance at our message and think we are reaching out for a job opportunity. Make sure to write the email in a way that makes it clear we are reaching out to sell them a service. 
    6. Always mention that we work off no commitment contracts that are month to month allowing them to test us out risk free 
    7. Do not use special characters from the info I give you 
    8. Never referred to a company’s founding year, thats cheesy sales 
    9. You need to customize every single sentence in this paragraph to incorporate words, phrases from the job description and or their website. No matter the sentence, always incorporate something custom from their job description or the company info I give you. 
    10. Never just write info from the job post, it shows that we simply just copied and pasted from their job description. So don’t write: “I saw your job post where you said you wanted someone to do blah blah blah”. Don’t be that explicit with your personalization from the job post and the company info. You need to customize every single sentence in this paragraph to incorporate words, phrases from the job description and or their website 
    11. Mentions the lead’s target market and/or target audience 
    12. Always include a secret message about how we can save them money and make sure their team is operating efficiently - dont be so explicit because it’s a sensitive subject with outsourcing and cutting costs 
    13. Do not explicitly state that we help other clients in their particular industry - especially when its ultra specialized or geographically limited - I dont want leads to think we have expertise in industries or areas we dont - it also just sounds ridiculous when you state that we have a ton of experience in some ultra ultra specialized market or industry that is so obviously false or exaggerated based just on the statistical chances 
    14. Don’t make definitive statements about how we do something - in a concrete statement - be more suggestive as if we can do something rather than we already do it - for example, when you write “Our team supports quoting, lead intake, and outreach across product lines like PT systems, automation components, and electrical controls—engaging MRO buyers and operations leads” - you say “our team supports..” as if that is something that we already do - which seems exaggerated - its more like our team can support…it sounds more reasonable
    15. Never just write info from the job post, it shows that we simply just copied and pasted from their job description. So don’t write: “I saw your job post where you said you wanted someone to do blah blah blah”. Don’t be that explicit with your personalization from the job post and the company info
    16. Anytime you find anything on the job description that is a lead generation or sales development task like cold calling, prospecting, appointment setting, list building, or any of the services that salaria provides, talk about how we can take over those tasks. Don’t get confused from taking things off the job post and saying we can help their sales rep “do more high volume calls” - that is an SDR or task that a BDR would do or a task that salaria would do. So it just sound weird when you say that we are going to help with lead generation tasks to free up your sales reps to do more cold calling - right? - because cold calling is a lead generation task that we would take on. It’s important to stay focused on the deal closing tasks on the job description. You can even pull tasks that you think we should take on and then make the argument that their team should be more focused on the deal closing tasks and then you can name the items from the job posts that we can take on instead of them
    17. Always start the message off with “Hi [First Name]” - fill in the first name field with the first name of the person I’m messaging
    18. Never mention the mission statement of a lead’s company - that is a very cheesy sales technique and perceived as a lazy way to personalize. If you talk about how much you “appreciate” someones values and mission statements, they might perceive that as disingenuous and overly salesy
    19. Never mention the name Salaria in the email - never mention Salaria by name - always say “We” like “We can help you with..”

    Instruction 1: 

    Help me build a linkedin connection follow up message to sales leads for my company, salaria sales solutions, (salariasales.com). With this strategy which we call the SDR recruitment strategy, we are targeting companies that are hiring for sales development or business development representatives - BDRs or SDR positions - which is a junior sales position that is focused on top of the funnel sales tasks - the exact same tasks that salaria specializes in. This is different from our AE strategy, where we are targeting companies that are hiring for AE positions. With that strategy, we are making an argument to companies that they should hire us to help support their sales reps - so instead of their sales reps doing all of the full sales cycle of activities themselves, including top of the funnel sales tasks, we can take care of those tasks for their sales reps and their sales reps can be more focused on revenue generating activities. With the SDR Strategy, We look for companies with open SDR job posts and send them outreach to introduce ourselves as an alternative to hiring internally. We also work with companies that have internal teams, we usually will augment existing SDR teams. I’m creating this bot to help me create a follow up message to sales leads that connect with me on Linkedin. This is a message I will send after the sales lead has connected with me on Linkedin. We have already crafted an elaborately customized email that we sent to the lead already so there is a good chance that the sales lead has already seen my email. Its important that we acknowledge that they might have already seen my email. I’m going to give you the entire email we wrote the sales lead and then you can simply incorporate the email. Maybe change a few words here and there to show that you didnt just copy and paste the email. I think most reasonable people would agree that it wouldn't make sense for me to write an entirely new email message after having written something as custom as I wrote. So just write how I appreciate the sales lead agreeing to connect with me, how I’m not certain that they have seen my email and incorporate all of the information from the email with slight changes. 
    
    Instruction 2: 

    I’m now going to start feeding you all of the email that you wrote in a separate chat and the original connection message that the lead accepted. I need you to write a follow up message to the connection request. Here are the rules for writing the Linkedin Connection 2 (LC2)
    
    Follow these rules for writing Linkedin Connection 2 (Lc2): 
    
    1. Thank the lead for connecting with me 
    2. Use the email in its entirety don’t make too many changes 
    3. Ask the lead if they would be willing to set up a call to introduce ourselves
    4. Acknowledge that there is a good chance that the lead might have already seen my original email with the same content. 
    5. make it very easy for me to copy and paste into my email account to send it - don’t include brackets after the greeting “best” - cut these kinds of brackets: Best, [Your Name] Salaria Sales Solutions [Your Contact Info][Calendly Link] - don’t fill them in or anything. The email should end with “Best,” don’t write anything below it. Make sure to start the email with address the lead we are reaching out to. So if we are reaching out to Jeff, the Email should start with “Jeff,”
    6. Don’t re-write the email we wrote - its already super customized - don’t take anything out - just mention how they might have seen my emai but we want to follow up here in case they didnt see it - so you can use the original email in it’s entirety

    “Salaria has been a game changer for us! We have tried various companies and internal processes to manage a rather 
    difficult lead gen process and they have performed way better than we expected. They adapt to our feedback. They 
    provide clear information. A majority of our sales pipeline is from Salaria. They are always looking for ways to 
    improve. If you are on the fence, just pull the trigger. Salaria will do everything they say and more!”

    “I enjoyed my experience with Salaria! My account manager was Elizabeth and she really knew her stuff. Communication
    was consistent and seamless. Staff was professional and left no gaps. I felt like a priority… like I was the only 
    customer on their roster, even though I know I was only one of many. Great job and highly recommended.”

    Salaria Sales Solutions scheduled 2–3 qualified meetings per week for the client’s team of Sales Account Executives.
    The team delivered on time with weekly meetings to review progress, assess and adjust messaging, and review upcoming
    meetings. They used a technology stack that enabled effective outreach.
    
    Doug Miller
    President, SaylzeVP
    “Salaria is amazing! I have spoken with several companies like Salaria, but I have found them to be mostly talk. 
    Salaria does exactly what they say they are going to do – they get meetings! I greatly appreciated that even though 
    we had a slow start, they came in an worked hard to earn regain our trust. They are always tweaking and improving 
    their process to make sure they are meeting our needs.”

    Vice President Operations at LARVOL
    “Great company and great people.  I am super impressed with our director of account management LP and his team.  I 
    have been with  them for about 4 months and just signed for a 6 month extension.  I have been getting TOO MANY HIGH 
    QUALITY LEADS to manage and am now forced to build out my sales team because of Salaria 🙂 Highly recommended.  The 
    cost will pay for itself quickly.”
    
    Jason Sonos
    CEO at Power Production Management
    “As someone who has been in medical device sales for 10 years now, I highly recommend Salaria to anyone who is

    “Salaria has been a huge boost to our lead generation efforts.  They are able to create meetings with high level 
    executives who are vetted properly. I’ve closed multiple big ticket deals from Salaria. Great company to work with.”
    
    James Hoover
    Director of Business Development at RenewAge
    “Salaria is a fantastic B2B lead generation agency. I’ve worked with quite a few firms, and these guys are the best 
    hands down. I’ve been working with them for years now. At my last firm, I hired them and they helped us close deals 
    with DocuSend and Peloton. I’ve recently moved to a new firm and re-hired Salaria. Just a few months in, they’ve 
    brought us an incredible amount of leads and we’ve already closed a deal. Highly recommended!”
    
    Jason Stern
    CEO at GetThru
    Jason Stern
    “We started working with Salaria about 10 months ago and they have been able to generate about 60-70 meetings of 
    which 4 deals have closed. I was a bit skeptical before deciding to work with them because I didn’t know if we could
    effectively outsource part of our sales development strategy. I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how well things have
    gone. We’ve also seen an improvement in conversion rates across the whole team because we started using a lot of the
    scripts and templates Salaria was using. I have to admit that they’ve been impressive with how helpful they’ve been 
    from a strategy perspective. Highly recommend these guys!”

    FAQS/Objection Handling:
    How do you compare to an internal hire?
    
    1. I’m cheaper. I think I’m the best option if you are looking to be careful with resource allocation.
    2. I’m not a junior. I can pick things up quickly and you don’t have to train me.
    3. You can fire me after 90 days. Firing an SDR three months into the role is a bit harder to do.
    4. I’ve consistently beaten the productivity of internal SDRs. Our outreach and prospecting volume and customization is nearly impossible for the average SDR to match. "
    
    You don't have experience in this industry, how do you make up for that?
    I have not worked with any firms in your industry as of yet. Although, I can assure you that our methodologies have a track record of success across a diverse set of industries. I work with a machine learning startup in Silicon Valley, a clothing manufacturer in LA, a cybersecurity company in Beirut to name a few and we've delivered results across the board.
    How big is your team/support staff?
    I have about 15 people on staff and growing. I have implemented multiple layers of quality control and accountability across my organization. This limits errors on our end and allows us to constantly improve our processes.
    How do you ensure that the calls scheduled are with the right type of prospects every time?
    The first week of our engagement is focused on me digging into your business and crafting a game plan for how to get started. As a part of that onboarding process, I will work with you or your team to identify your ICP (industry, company type, headcount, titles, geography - we can get really detailed and granular) and then we'll begin delivering fresh leads that match those ICP parameters. It then falls on us to make sure that we stick to those prospecting guidelines thus ensuring that the meetings we ultimately set are with the right type of prospects.
    How do you avoid reaching out to our existing clients or leads?
    I have an onboarding checklist and one of the steps is to review current client lists and create a process around preventing overlap. Typically, we'll cross-reference a current client sheet before prospecting a company. This prevents the issues at the very top of the funnel.
    What makes Salaria different from competitors?
    We have found our model to be much more effective than other agencies and freelancers that you receive messages from everyday. First, we are a legitimate B2B lead generation agency with offices around the world and USA-based MBA level consultants that operate as account managers and strategists for our clients. We help our clients craft messaging, strategy and then manage everything for them. Most of the messages you get are from freelancers or very small inexperienced agencies. Secondly, we have the ability to do every sales development, lead generation activity at a very high volume. For example, we prospect/list build around 20 new, highly targeted and qualified companies every day with 1-4 leads/contacts at each company depending on the guidelines we put in place. That means we can typically prospect 60-80 new leads a day/1,200-1,600 per month. We also can target small, niche markets with a smaller total addressable market. Furthermore, we offer cold calling services while most of the folks reaching out to you via email and LinkedIn are fully automated and just spray and pray on those two channels. We are able to customize and personalize our outreach in ways that our competitor’s can’t. Even our responses to leads, such as our back and forth here, are completely tailored and not cookie-cutter. Finally, we don't rely too much on automation and technology to do the job for us. We leverage technology when it makes sense, but the complex, dynamic components of our processes are done by humans. Hope that helps. Would like to chat if you are interested in working with us.
    Do you work within the veterinary space?  Or have you?
    
    I have not worked in the veterinary space before but I have a very diverse client base with a successful track record across the board. I work with companies in manufacturing, AI/Machine learning, energy, cybersecurity, and travel media. As odd as this might sound, I also thought you'd be interested to know that I'm starting a pet supply company with my sister so I have a genuine love for animals and appreciation for the industry in general.
    Is actual cold-calling involved in your process or is primarily cadencing using email/social tools?
    
    Yes, cold calling is one of our outreach strategies. Most of the people we call have expressed initial interest in our digital outreach. This way, we aren’t calling folks completely cold and they have some context when they pick up.
    Can you tell me how you help grow pipeline?
    
    I operate similarly to a full-time remote SDR. I offer tailored prospecting and high volume, personalized outreach via email and social channels. I'd be more than willing to jump on a quick call if you're interested.
    If you're interested in applying to any of our positions, you'll need to complete an online application on HireArt to be considered
    
    I'm a BDR consultant operating as a 1099 for my clients. I'm an alternative to hiring a full-time, W-2 BDR.
    Are you the resource, or do you contract?
    
    I'm the resource - essentially a remote SDR.
    How much of those touchpoints are automated vs manual?
    
    Nearly everything we do including prospecting, CRM management, appointment setting/coordinating, LinkedIn outreach, objection handling and calling ( < included with package 2) is manual and custom to each client. The only thing we have automated as of yet is email marketing. This is because we send out thousands of emails per month including follow-ups and that would be virtually impossible to do manually. Our email marketing automation tools also provide A/B testing metrics to optimize and continuously improve our messaging. The tools and methods we use will also protect you from getting blocked by spam filters ( < also really important).
    Do you use my Linkedin?
    
    We do utilize the LinkedIn accounts of our clients. You should look at us as simply a LinkedIn marketing tool - supercharging and automating your team's LinkedIn outreach like a software solution would.
    Is this primarily Linkedin outreach?
    
    Yes, social outreach is primarily done via LinkedIn for most B2B clients. Sometimes clients want us to reach out to leads in other unique ways such as on personal social media channels, industry forums, or group chats on platforms like Reddit. Most times, LinkedIn is good enough and you don't want to scare leads away by being overly aggressive.
    Am I going to have access to everything?
    
    We are radically transparent about everything. You will have full access to all accounts, tools, and software that we use throughout our engagement. Additionally, we send you updates about everything: morning reports, meeting alerts, response alerts, daily/weekly metrics. If you can't find something, my team and I are always here to help.
    What is your pricing?
    
    
    Depending on your needs, we would build out a custom price. We don't have set flat rates. Typically, our pricing is comparable to hiring an internal sales rep, although our production is about 2-3X an internal hire. Could we discuss more over the phone?
    Where is your calling team based out of?
    
    Our approach here is unique. Our "high-volume" cold calling team is offshore, mainly in the Philippines. We also have a team in the USA that takes the more nuanced and complex follow-up calls and assists our offshore team when needed. Our USA-based team is  made up of business school grads and military veterans.
    Do you have experience with Zendesk Sell or Reply.io?
    
    We don’t have experience with Zendesk Sell or Reply.io but I’m confident we can become accustomed to them very quickly. We’ll likely also introduce you to sales and marketing tools that you might not have experience with but would likely be interested in.
    Can you work with our existing lead list?
    
    Yes, we can work with an existing lead list. We could also work to build new lists to test different strategies.
    Can do commission based model?
    
    I can't do a commission based model.
    Where are you located? Are you an American-based?
    
    Our headquarter is in Washington, DC and our staff are based in the US and around the world. We have a unique hybrid model of international and USA based teams of Business Development professionals. We are able to customize a team to fit your needs best. We can provide you with fully U.S. based cold calling, international cold calling services or whatever mix you feel is best for your team. You main point of contact will always be based in the USA and would be an experienced sales development consultant and account manager.
    What quality of lists do you require?
    
    Do you need an org name, title, phone, and email to be successful, or can we send you a list of target organizations for enrichment? How many leads do you need at a given time to reach critical mass? If you offer it, does enrichment cost extra/how much does it add to the timeline?
    We don’t have any requirements from you regarding lists.
    
    Whatever you have, we can take it and enrich it at no extra cost. We’ll likely also want to build our own lists from a traditional prospecting approach but your data could definitely supplement our efforts and get us to critical mass quicker.
    How much, if any, time will be required on our part to help you craft messages and train the team? You mentioned one of your primary strengths is as a copywriter. Is there a difference in cost if we do the copywriting vs have you do it?
    
    The copy usually takes a day or two out of our five day onboarding process. If you already have copy, we can run with it immediately but I wouldn’t be able to offer a discount.
    What does your ramp-up schedule look like? How long do you expect it to take to start setting your first appointments? How long until you're operating at full capacity?
    
    We will be able to generate early results within the first month typically. We are fully ramped up in 90 days. This is a conservative estimate, some clients are very successful right out the gate.
    Is there a difference in cost during the ramp period? There are firms out there that charge only for qualified appointments set. Do you offer that sort of contingency?
    
    We’re on a fixed fee retainer.
    I understand you allow clients to go month-to-month. Is there a minimum time commitment on the contract?
    
    There is no minimum time commitment but I highly suggest you give us at least 90 days to prove ourselves.
    When you say "we average 65-75 lead contacts prospected/day" what does that mean? Are you saying you generate contact information for 65-75 new individuals with the appropriate titles at the organizations we're targeting? Or, is it something else?
    
    Exactly, these contacts would be well qualified and within the guardrails/parameters that we set. Again, we could also supplement our list with any data that you’ve already accumulated.																									Would your team need @harborcompliance.com email addresses/access to our CRM?
    Will they be creating LinkedIn profiles of their own with our company in the profile, or do you require us to share profile access with them?
    We would need access to Linkedin profiles, again for credibility. If this is a sticking point, we do have some Linkedin accounts we could use from subcontractors of mine but that would be another fee.
    How many of them are there?
    I’m not sure I understand this question. We’d assign about 2 dedicated cold callers to your account and 2 dedicated prospecting associates, as well as a USA associate. In addition, about 15 other employees will be helping manage your account in a variety of ways such as QA, data entry, management, training etc.
    My main hang-up with this deal is that we're paying you for activity rather than results. I'd feel much better if we had some basic ideas about how many appointments we can expect. What is your average conversion rate like?
    If we hand you a list of 1000 organizations we'd like to target, how many of those organizations would you expect to be able to set an appointment with?
    
    "I would say that in a sense that you are still paying us for the results. At the end of the day, if you don’t achieve ROI from our services, our engagement won’t last very long. If all of my clients canceled after 30-90/days, I wouldn’t really have a business. Since inception, we’ve retained nearly all of our clients because of our performance. At a minimum, most of my clients with one seat are getting 3-7 meetings/per week. I have a few clients who have scaled up with us that are achieving 10-20/meetings per week. I think Harbor Compliance is well positioned with a really compelling product so I’d imagine we’d be able to achieve above average meeting volume. At the end of the day, any number I give you is purely an estimate and arbitrary.

At the end of the day, any number I give you is purely an estimate and arbitrary.	• Yes, but that is included in my costs. I will upgrade whatever profile you give us.
    • So, am I to understand that we'd be paying for a single "seat" to get at least 3-7 meetings per week? If we added additional "seats" would we be billed $7650 for each one we add? If that's the case, would adding two seats put us in the 6-14 meeting/week range? When you say "scaled up" how many seats do those clients have?	• Exactly. My most successful client who gets about 20 meetings a week is at 6 seats. Although, their business is much different and is not a perfect comparable.
    Do your reps require access to our CRM?
    This is completely up to you. We can create our own Salesforce and keep everything separate.
    Are we able to take what we learn from our engagement together and use it to train our own reps in the future even after the engagement has ended?
    
    Yes, you can. I’m prepared to be pretty transparent about our processes and systems. This is mainly to protect me from clients sharing information with my competitors. That I’m not comfortable with.
    
    
    
    Objection Handling:
    
    Straight NI: Are you still hiring for the (Job title) position?
    
    Objection #1: Where are you located?
    Answer: We are located in the United States.
    Headquarters: Washington, DC
    
    Objection #2: How did you get my number?
    Answer: “We have a contact info database that we use to find phone numbers.”
    
    If someone asks you, “which database?”
    “It’s called rocket reach.”
    
    If they continue to ask you more information about how you got their information
    “I really didn’t mean to bother you, I can just take you off our list.”
    
    
    Objection #4: I tried outsourcing before and haven’t had any success.
    Answer: I completely understand. We’ve actually worked with a lot of companies that have had unsuccessful engagements and campaigns with other lead generation companies. But all I can say is that we do things differently and have a very unique model that is different from any other lead generation or sales development you've worked with. We would love to walk you through exactly how we are different. Would you be interested in setting up a quick introductory call with us?
    
    Objection #5: Why should we work with you vs hiring a full time employee.
    Answer: Our biggest differentiator is that we hit a much higher volume across every activity that we do. 400-800 cold calls a day, 65 highly targeted prospected leads, huge amounts of reachout via emails, and linkedin. Hiring 1 person you get the volume of 1 person, with us you get the volume of up to 15 people a day.
    
    Objection #6: Do you have experience selling to [X] industry?
    Answer:
    -Absolutely! [Client List]
    -Yes, we work with firms across a diverse set of industry types including private equity, SaaS, agencies, healthcare, energy, real-estate. I think the best course of action is for me to schedule a meeting between you and my manager, who can talk more specifically about our experience about [X] industry.
    
    Objection #7: Where are your callers located?
    Answer: Our cold calling team is based in the United States and from around the world. If you were to work with us, you can choose where your cold caller is located. It can be international or you can work with US only cold callers. It's up to you on what you would prefer.
    
    Objection #8: I already hired someone/I already hired Sales Development reps or BDRs
    Answer: We work with many companies that have their own teams and sales development reps. We make them more efficient by handling repetitive tasks, so they can focus on account-based marketing and creative tasks.
    
    Objection #9: Outsourcing cost more
    Answer: Our services are typically commensurate with the cost of hiring internally. We would love to break it down actually on a call. Would you be interested in setting up a quick introductory call with us?
    
    Objection #11: We are still figuring out our strategy, who to target and what our messaging would be.
    Answer: One thing that makes us really unique from other lead generation and sales development companies is that we are McKinsey level consultants, and we can definitely help you craft that messaging and  strategy that you need. Another thing that would make us unique is that we do things at a very high volume across numerous channels and thousands and thousands of leads. Thus our sample size of data is much larger, which you can use to figure out who is responding as well as the right people to target. Rather than you guys figuring things out on your own,  we can essentially test the market at scale and help you craft that strategy. We would love to tell you more about how we can be helpful from a strategic consulting perspective.
    
    Objection #12: We are already using [X sales tool]
    Answer: We’re a full-service sales development consulting and lead generation company. We do high-volume cold calling, custom prospecting, and huge amounts of outreach via emails, SMS, and LinkedIn.
    Objection #13: Can you do a commission based model? Can you do a pay per lead model? Can you do a pay per meeting model?
    
    Answer: No,  we do not do pay  per lead/pay per meeting type of model. We are a full service consulting company and invest a significant amount in our clients, and offer strategic consulting at the front end. We would love to tell you more about how we are. Would you be open to learning more about us?
    
    Objection #14: We are looking for somebody that does more than that. (prospecting, cold calling and email marketing.)
    
    We saw on the job post that you are looking for somebody to also do prospecting, email marketing and cold calling as well. Those are some of the things and ways in which we can help. We would love to at least show you how we operate and how we can help you on those components of your need.
    Would you be open to learning more about us?
    
    Objection #15: We work with the government, I don't know if we can work with you.
    We have worked with government contractors and even with cybersecurity companies that work with government contractors, so we have plenty of experience working in that area.
    
    Objection #16: Lead wants to have callers that DOES NOT HAVE a foreign accent.
    "We have a hybrid model where the majority of our high-volume cold callers are based in the Philippines, but you will also have a U.S. Sales Associate assigned to your account that focuses on warm leads or chasing calls. Our team in the Philippines speaks very clear English, but you may notice an accent with some of the callers. We have found that the leads we call are more concerned with the value proposition and what our clients are offering, rather than focusing too much on the caller's accent."
    
    Objection #17: (Head of Company, CEO only) Referral to somebody lower Level
    Answer: I'll definitely reach out and send an email. Thank you for referring us to them. It's just that we were also hoping to introduce ourselves to you as we know that you lead the company. Ultimately, if we are going to do business together, you would have to sign off on it. So we were just also hoping to introduce ourselves to you. Would you be open to setting up a call as well?
    
    Objection #18 : Pricing question over the phone
    Answer: Our pricing ranges from $6500-$7500 per month
    
    Objection #19 : Are you a recruiter?/ Is this a recruitment firm?
    Answer: No, I'm not a recruiter. We're not a recruitment firm, we are actually a B2B lead generation firm and sometimes people think that we're recruiters because I'm referencing this job post that we saw on (job site) for an Account Executive. But the reason I'm actually referencing that job post is because we thought that you would be interested in our services to help this new account executive that you plan to hire. We would book them sales meetings for them to take and close deals from. That's what we do and that's why we are calling today to see if you'd be open to learning more about us.
