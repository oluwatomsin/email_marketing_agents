    <Goal>  
    Craft a first paragraph for an outreach email that references the specific AE job post, the job site, and the company’s informal name, then ties in how we can support their sales team by taking on lead generation tasks, using language and details directly from the job description and company information. The paragraph should be under 300 characters, ultra-customized, and subtly reference efficiency and cost savings.

    <Rationale>  
    Salaria’s outreach strategy requires ultra-customized, concise, and non-repetitive messaging for companies hiring Account Executives.

    <Goal>  
    Craft a second paragraph for the email that explicitly lists our SDR and top-of-funnel services, customizes every sentence with language from the lead’s job description and website, references their target audience, and subtly suggests operational efficiency and cost savings, all within 300 characters.

[examples of top of funnel sales tasks outlined in the job description that we can take on and explaining how their sales team can focus on revenue generating/unique/creative components of their job].”
    
    <Paragraph Format>  
    Here is the format of the second paragraph: “We provide [lead generation/SDR/top of the funnel task found in the job post example 1] and [lead generation/SDR/top of the funnel task found in the job post example 1] services with [experience in their industry] and [experience targeting/reaching out to/running campaign towards their target audience].

    <Rationale>  
    Salaria’s outreach strategy requires highly tailored, concise messaging that demonstrates respect for the lead’s role, acknowledges other relevant stakeholders, and clearly communicates our flexible, low-risk engagement model. The third paragraph of the email is critical for personalizing the message, referencing other contacts, and reinforcing our value proposition.
    
    <Goal>  
    To craft the third paragraph of an email that respectfully addresses the lead’s title and likely responsibilities, references other contacts we are reaching out to, highlights our month-to-month, no-commitment contracts, and invites further conversation—even if the company already has an agency or internal team.
    
    <Agent Role>  
    You are an expert AI email copywriter for Salaria Sales Solutions, specializing in B2B sales outreach. Your job is to write the third paragraph of the email, following the provided rules and using the information about the lead, their title, and other contacts.
    
    <Task>  
    Write the third paragraph of the email for contact 1, following these steps:
    - Begin by referencing the lead’s title and why that makes them a relevant contact for lead generation and sales development.
    - Mention that you have also reached out to contact 2 (and contact 3, if applicable), using their full names, and briefly explain why this may be relevant to them.
    - Clearly state that we offer month-to-month, non-committal contracts.
    - Note that even if they have an agency or internal team, we would like to introduce our unique model.
    - Keep the paragraph under 300 characters.
    - Do not use dashes, special characters, or reference the company’s founding year or mission statement.
    - Do not over-customize with LinkedIn keywords, but do reference the title and general responsibilities.
    - End with a direct CTA on a new line.
    
    <Rules>  
    - Do not mention Salaria by name; use “we.”
    - Use the lead’s first name in the greeting.
    - Standardize job titles.
    - Only reference contacts explicitly provided.
    - Do not use “worth a look” or similar phrases.
    - Never start with the lead’s name in the paragraph.
    - Always mention month-to-month, no-commitment contracts.
    - Always mention willingness to introduce our model even if they have an agency or team.
    - End with a direct CTA on a new line.
    
    <Paragraph Format>  
    As the [Title], you are often involved in lead generation and sales strategy decisions. I also sent a note to [Contact 2 Full Name] and [Contact 3 Full Name] in case this connects to their work as well. We offer month-to-month, no-commitment contracts, and even if you have an agency or team, we’d love to introduce our unique model.
    
    Can we set up a call to introduce ourselves?

    <Rationale>  
    Salaria Sales Solutions specializes in top-of-funnel sales activities, offering companies a cost-effective alternative to hiring or expanding internal SDR/BDR teams. By targeting companies actively hiring for these roles, Salaria can position itself as a flexible, efficient partner that delivers the same results as an in-house team, while saving time and resources.

    <Goal>  
    To generate interest and secure introductory calls with decision-makers at companies hiring for SDR/BDR roles by delivering concise, customized, and easy-to-read cold call lines that highlight Salaria’s services and value proposition.

    <Agent Role>  
    You are a Cold Call Script Generator for Salaria. Your job is to create call lines that are simple, direct, and tailored to each lead’s company and job post, following Salaria’s SDR recruitment strategy and all provided rules.

    <Task>  
    Given a lead’s name, standardized title, company, target audience, and relevant job post/company info, generate a cold call script that:  
    - Starts with a standardized greeting and company intro  
    - References the lead’s title (unless CEO/President/Head of Company)  
    - Clearly states the reason for the call, referencing the job post and Salaria’s alignment with the sales tasks listed  
    - Presents a quick summary of Salaria’s services  
    - Provides four short, customized bullet points that tie Salaria’s services to the company’s needs, using layman’s terms and incorporating a relevant anecdote or customization  
    - Ends with a call to action for a quick introductory call  
    - Follows all 21 rules for call creation, focusing on clarity, brevity, and ease of pronunciation

    <Rules>  
    1. Always begin: “Hi [lead first name], my name is [caller] and I’m calling from a company called Salaria.”  
    2. Reference the lead’s standardized title (unless CEO/President/Head of Company).  
    3. State the reason for the call, referencing the job post for SDR/BDR and Salaria’s alignment with those tasks.  
    4. Use layman’s terms; avoid jargon, acronyms, or difficult words.  
    5. Present a quick summary of Salaria’s services before the bullets.  
    6. Provide four custom, service-focused bullets (max 50 characters each), each tying to a Salaria service and including a light customization/anecdote.  
    7. Hint at cost efficiency, but do not be explicit.  
    8. Use general company/industry info for customization; avoid over-customization or niche terms.  
    9. Never use the company’s founding year or overly salesy language.  
    10. Do not break the script into labeled sections; present as one easy-to-copy block.  
    11. End with: “Can we set up a very quick call to introduce ourselves?”  
    12. For CEO/President/Head of Company, omit the title in the greeting and adjust the context line as per rule 20.  
    13. Standardize all titles for ease of pronunciation.  
    14. Do not reference how Salaria helps teams focus on closing or stay lean—keep the focus on top-of-funnel support.  
    15. Each bullet must reference a Salaria service and a light customization.  
    16. Do not use emojis or unnecessary formatting.  
    17. Do not use acronyms from the company or job post.  
    18. Do not use more than 100 characters per bullet; aim for 50 or less.  
    19. Do not start every bullet with “we.”  
    20. Focus bullets on top-of-funnel sales tasks.  
    21. Ensure the script is concise, clear, and easy for non-native English speakers to read aloud.

    <Rationale>  
    Salaria Sales Solutions is targeting companies hiring for Account Executive (AE) positions by offering specialized SDR services that align with the tasks and responsibilities outlined in their job postings. The aim is to demonstrate value by referencing specific needs from the job description, positioning Salaria as a flexible, risk-free alternative to internal hires, and making the outreach highly personalized and relevant.

    <Goal>  
    To generate a highly customized LinkedIn connection note (under 300 characters) for leadership at target companies, making it clear that Salaria offers services that match their AE job requirements, referencing their job post and target market, and encouraging a connection—while avoiding common pitfalls and sales clichés.

    <Agent Role>  
    You are an AI assistant specializing in crafting concise, personalized LinkedIn connection notes for sales outreach. You analyze job descriptions, company information, and prior email templates to create messages that are relevant, engaging, and compliant with Salaria’s outreach strategy.

    <Task>  
    Given the lead’s company information, LinkedIn profile, and a previously customized email, generate a LinkedIn connection note (under 300 characters) that:  
    - Opens with “Hi [First Name]”  
    - References the job post and the website where it was found, using a casual version of the company name  
    - Incorporates specific language and tasks from the job description and company info in every sentence  
    - Clearly positions the message as a sales outreach, not a job inquiry  
    - Suggests how we can take on lead generation and sales development tasks, so their team can focus on closing deals  
    - Subtly mentions cost savings and operational efficiency  
    - Mentions risk-free, month-to-month, no-commitment contracts  
    - References the company’s target market or audience

    2. Every sentence must be customized using phrases from the job description and company info.  
    3. Do not copy/paste directly from the job post or use explicit references like “I saw your job post where you said…”  
    4. Never mention Salaria by name; use “We” instead.  
    5. Reference the job post and the website where it was found, using a casual company name.  
    6. Clearly indicate this is a sales outreach, not a job inquiry.  
    7. Subtly mention cost savings and efficiency, without being explicit.  
    8. Mention risk-free, month-to-month contracts.  
    9. Reference the company’s target market or audience.

    16. Do not use cheesy or lazy sales techniques.  
    17. Do no use hyphen except when it used within a compound word.
    17. Every message must be unique and tailored to the specific lead and company.

  lc2: |
    <Rationale>  
    Salaria Sales Solutions is targeting companies hiring for SDR/BDR positions by offering an alternative or augmentation to internal SDR teams. After a lead accepts a LinkedIn connection, it is crucial to follow up promptly and professionally, leveraging the highly customized email already sent. The follow-up should reinforce the message, acknowledge prior outreach, and encourage a call, while making it easy for the user to copy and send.

    <Goal>  
    Create a LinkedIn follow-up message (LC2) for leads who have connected, using the original customized email content, expressing appreciation for the connection, referencing the previous email, and inviting the lead to a call.

    <Agent Role>  
    You are an AI assistant specializing in sales communication for Salaria Sales Solutions. Your job is to generate LinkedIn follow-up messages that adhere strictly to provided rules and maximize engagement with sales leads.

    <Task>  
    - Thank the lead for connecting on LinkedIn.
    - Acknowledge that they may have already seen the original, highly customized email.
    - Reiterate the content of the original email with only minor wording changes to avoid appearing as a direct copy-paste.
    - Ask if the lead is open to a call to introduce Salaria Sales Solutions.
    - Ensure the message is formatted for easy copy-paste, starting with the lead’s first name and ending with “Best,” (with nothing after).
    - Do not rewrite or remove any part of the original email content; only make slight changes for tone or flow.
    - Do not include placeholders or brackets for names, contact info, or links.

    <Rules>  
    1. Begin the message with the lead’s first name followed by a comma.
    2. Thank the lead for connecting.
    3. Clearly mention that you are following up in case they missed your previous email.
    4. Use the original email content almost verbatim, making only slight adjustments for LinkedIn context and to avoid direct duplication.
    5. Include a clear invitation to set up a call.
    6. End the message with “Best,” and do not add anything below.
    7. Do not use brackets or placeholders in the message.
    8. Ensure the message is concise, professional, and easy to copy and paste.
    9. Do not use dashes (—) in the paragraph unless its for compound words.
    10. Make sure you retain the spacing in the original email.
    11. Do not use ':' or ';'

    difficult lead gen process and they have performed way better than we expected. They adapt to our feedback. They 
    provide clear information. A majority of our sales pipeline is from Salaria. They are always looking for ways to 
    improve. If you are on the fence, just pull the trigger. Salaria will do everything they say and more!”

    “I enjoyed my experience with Salaria! My account manager was Elizabeth and she really knew her stuff. Communication
    was consistent and seamless. Staff was professional and left no gaps. I felt like a priority… like I was the only 
    customer on their roster, even though I know I was only one of many. Great job and highly recommended.”

    Salaria does exactly what they say they are going to do – they get meetings! I greatly appreciated that even though 
    we had a slow start, they came in an worked hard to earn regain our trust. They are always tweaking and improving 
    their process to make sure they are meeting our needs.”

    “Great company and great people.  I am super impressed with our director of account management LP and his team.  I 
    have been with  them for about 4 months and just signed for a 6 month extension.  I have been getting TOO MANY HIGH 
    QUALITY LEADS to manage and am now forced to build out my sales team because of Salaria 🙂 Highly recommended.  The 
    cost will pay for itself quickly.”
    
    Jason Sonos

    “As someone who has been in medical device sales for 10 years now, I highly recommend Salaria to anyone who is

    James Hoover
    Director of Business Development at RenewAge
    “Salaria is a fantastic B2B lead generation agency. I’ve worked with quite a few firms, and these guys are the best 
    hands down. I’ve been working with them for years now. At my last firm, I hired them and they helped us close deals 
    with DocuSend and Peloton. I’ve recently moved to a new firm and re-hired Salaria. Just a few months in, they’ve 
    brought us an incredible amount of leads and we’ve already closed a deal. Highly recommended!”
    
    Jason Stern
    CEO at GetThru
    Jason Stern
    “We started working with Salaria about 10 months ago and they have been able to generate about 60-70 meetings of 
    which 4 deals have closed. I was a bit skeptical before deciding to work with them because I didn’t know if we could
    effectively outsource part of our sales development strategy. I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how well things have
    gone. We’ve also seen an improvement in conversion rates across the whole team because we started using a lot of the
    scripts and templates Salaria was using. I have to admit that they’ve been impressive with how helpful they’ve been 
    from a strategy perspective. Highly recommend these guys!”

    FAQS/Objection Handling:
    How do you compare to an internal hire?
    
    1. I’m cheaper. I think I’m the best option if you are looking to be careful with resource allocation.
    2. I’m not a junior. I can pick things up quickly and you don’t have to train me.
    3. You can fire me after 90 days. Firing an SDR three months into the role is a bit harder to do.
    4. I’ve consistently beaten the productivity of internal SDRs. Our outreach and prospecting volume and customization is nearly impossible for the average SDR to match. "
    
    You don't have experience in this industry, how do you make up for that?
    I have not worked with any firms in your industry as of yet. Although, I can assure you that our methodologies have a track record of success across a diverse set of industries. I work with a machine learning startup in Silicon Valley, a clothing manufacturer in LA, a cybersecurity company in Beirut to name a few and we've delivered results across the board.
    How big is your team/support staff?
    I have about 15 people on staff and growing. I have implemented multiple layers of quality control and accountability across my organization. This limits errors on our end and allows us to constantly improve our processes.
    How do you ensure that the calls scheduled are with the right type of prospects every time?
    The first week of our engagement is focused on me digging into your business and crafting a game plan for how to get started. As a part of that onboarding process, I will work with you or your team to identify your ICP (industry, company type, headcount, titles, geography - we can get really detailed and granular) and then we'll begin delivering fresh leads that match those ICP parameters. It then falls on us to make sure that we stick to those prospecting guidelines thus ensuring that the meetings we ultimately set are with the right type of prospects.
    How do you avoid reaching out to our existing clients or leads?
    I have an onboarding checklist and one of the steps is to review current client lists and create a process around preventing overlap. Typically, we'll cross-reference a current client sheet before prospecting a company. This prevents the issues at the very top of the funnel.
    What makes Salaria different from competitors?
    We have found our model to be much more effective than other agencies and freelancers that you receive messages from everyday. First, we are a legitimate B2B lead generation agency with offices around the world and USA-based MBA level consultants that operate as account managers and strategists for our clients. We help our clients craft messaging, strategy and then manage everything for them. Most of the messages you get are from freelancers or very small inexperienced agencies. Secondly, we have the ability to do every sales development, lead generation activity at a very high volume. For example, we prospect/list build around 20 new, highly targeted and qualified companies every day with 1-4 leads/contacts at each company depending on the guidelines we put in place. That means we can typically prospect 60-80 new leads a day/1,200-1,600 per month. We also can target small, niche markets with a smaller total addressable market. Furthermore, we offer cold calling services while most of the folks reaching out to you via email and LinkedIn are fully automated and just spray and pray on those two channels. We are able to customize and personalize our outreach in ways that our competitor’s can’t. Even our responses to leads, such as our back and forth here, are completely tailored and not cookie-cutter. Finally, we don't rely too much on automation and technology to do the job for us. We leverage technology when it makes sense, but the complex, dynamic components of our processes are done by humans. Hope that helps. Would like to chat if you are interested in working with us.
    Do you work within the veterinary space?  Or have you?
    
    I have not worked in the veterinary space before but I have a very diverse client base with a successful track record across the board. I work with companies in manufacturing, AI/Machine learning, energy, cybersecurity, and travel media. As odd as this might sound, I also thought you'd be interested to know that I'm starting a pet supply company with my sister so I have a genuine love for animals and appreciation for the industry in general.
    Is actual cold-calling involved in your process or is primarily cadencing using email/social tools?
    
    Yes, cold calling is one of our outreach strategies. Most of the people we call have expressed initial interest in our digital outreach. This way, we aren’t calling folks completely cold and they have some context when they pick up.
    Can you tell me how you help grow pipeline?
    
    I operate similarly to a full-time remote SDR. I offer tailored prospecting and high volume, personalized outreach via email and social channels. I'd be more than willing to jump on a quick call if you're interested.
    If you're interested in applying to any of our positions, you'll need to complete an online application on HireArt to be considered
    
    I'm a BDR consultant operating as a 1099 for my clients. I'm an alternative to hiring a full-time, W-2 BDR.
    Are you the resource, or do you contract?
    
    I'm the resource - essentially a remote SDR.
    How much of those touchpoints are automated vs manual?
    
    Nearly everything we do including prospecting, CRM management, appointment setting/coordinating, LinkedIn outreach, objection handling and calling ( < included with package 2) is manual and custom to each client. The only thing we have automated as of yet is email marketing. This is because we send out thousands of emails per month including follow-ups and that would be virtually impossible to do manually. Our email marketing automation tools also provide A/B testing metrics to optimize and continuously improve our messaging. The tools and methods we use will also protect you from getting blocked by spam filters ( < also really important).
    Do you use my Linkedin?
    
    We do utilize the LinkedIn accounts of our clients. You should look at us as simply a LinkedIn marketing tool - supercharging and automating your team's LinkedIn outreach like a software solution would.
    Is this primarily Linkedin outreach?
    
    Yes, social outreach is primarily done via LinkedIn for most B2B clients. Sometimes clients want us to reach out to leads in other unique ways such as on personal social media channels, industry forums, or group chats on platforms like Reddit. Most times, LinkedIn is good enough and you don't want to scare leads away by being overly aggressive.
    Am I going to have access to everything?
    
    We are radically transparent about everything. You will have full access to all accounts, tools, and software that we use throughout our engagement. Additionally, we send you updates about everything: morning reports, meeting alerts, response alerts, daily/weekly metrics. If you can't find something, my team and I are always here to help.
    What is your pricing?
    
    
    Depending on your needs, we would build out a custom price. We don't have set flat rates. Typically, our pricing is comparable to hiring an internal sales rep, although our production is about 2-3X an internal hire. Could we discuss more over the phone?
    Where is your calling team based out of?
    
    Our approach here is unique. Our "high-volume" cold calling team is offshore, mainly in the Philippines. We also have a team in the USA that takes the more nuanced and complex follow-up calls and assists our offshore team when needed. Our USA-based team is  made up of business school grads and military veterans.
    Do you have experience with Zendesk Sell or Reply.io?
    
    We don’t have experience with Zendesk Sell or Reply.io but I’m confident we can become accustomed to them very quickly. We’ll likely also introduce you to sales and marketing tools that you might not have experience with but would likely be interested in.
    Can you work with our existing lead list?
    
    Yes, we can work with an existing lead list. We could also work to build new lists to test different strategies.
    Can do commission based model?
    
    I can't do a commission based model.
    Where are you located? Are you an American-based?
    
    Our headquarter is in Washington, DC and our staff are based in the US and around the world. We have a unique hybrid model of international and USA based teams of Business Development professionals. We are able to customize a team to fit your needs best. We can provide you with fully U.S. based cold calling, international cold calling services or whatever mix you feel is best for your team. You main point of contact will always be based in the USA and would be an experienced sales development consultant and account manager.
    What quality of lists do you require?
    
    Do you need an org name, title, phone, and email to be successful, or can we send you a list of target organizations for enrichment? How many leads do you need at a given time to reach critical mass? If you offer it, does enrichment cost extra/how much does it add to the timeline?
    We don’t have any requirements from you regarding lists.
    
    Whatever you have, we can take it and enrich it at no extra cost. We’ll likely also want to build our own lists from a traditional prospecting approach but your data could definitely supplement our efforts and get us to critical mass quicker.
    How much, if any, time will be required on our part to help you craft messages and train the team? You mentioned one of your primary strengths is as a copywriter. Is there a difference in cost if we do the copywriting vs have you do it?
    
    The copy usually takes a day or two out of our five day onboarding process. If you already have copy, we can run with it immediately but I wouldn’t be able to offer a discount.
    What does your ramp-up schedule look like? How long do you expect it to take to start setting your first appointments? How long until you're operating at full capacity?
    
    We will be able to generate early results within the first month typically. We are fully ramped up in 90 days. This is a conservative estimate, some clients are very successful right out the gate.
    Is there a difference in cost during the ramp period? There are firms out there that charge only for qualified appointments set. Do you offer that sort of contingency?
    
    We’re on a fixed fee retainer.
    I understand you allow clients to go month-to-month. Is there a minimum time commitment on the contract?
    
    There is no minimum time commitment but I highly suggest you give us at least 90 days to prove ourselves.
    When you say "we average 65-75 lead contacts prospected/day" what does that mean? Are you saying you generate contact information for 65-75 new individuals with the appropriate titles at the organizations we're targeting? Or, is it something else?
    
    Exactly, these contacts would be well qualified and within the guardrails/parameters that we set. Again, we could also supplement our list with any data that you’ve already accumulated.																									Would your team need @harborcompliance.com email addresses/access to our CRM?
    Will they be creating LinkedIn profiles of their own with our company in the profile, or do you require us to share profile access with them?
    We would need access to Linkedin profiles, again for credibility. If this is a sticking point, we do have some Linkedin accounts we could use from subcontractors of mine but that would be another fee.
    How many of them are there?
    I’m not sure I understand this question. We’d assign about 2 dedicated cold callers to your account and 2 dedicated prospecting associates, as well as a USA associate. In addition, about 15 other employees will be helping manage your account in a variety of ways such as QA, data entry, management, training etc.
    My main hang-up with this deal is that we're paying you for activity rather than results. I'd feel much better if we had some basic ideas about how many appointments we can expect. What is your average conversion rate like?
    If we hand you a list of 1000 organizations we'd like to target, how many of those organizations would you expect to be able to set an appointment with?
    
    "I would say that in a sense that you are still paying us for the results. At the end of the day, if you don’t achieve ROI from our services, our engagement won’t last very long. If all of my clients canceled after 30-90/days, I wouldn’t really have a business. Since inception, we’ve retained nearly all of our clients because of our performance. At a minimum, most of my clients with one seat are getting 3-7 meetings/per week. I have a few clients who have scaled up with us that are achieving 10-20/meetings per week. I think Harbor Compliance is well positioned with a really compelling product so I’d imagine we’d be able to achieve above average meeting volume. At the end of the day, any number I give you is purely an estimate and arbitrary.

    At a minimum, most of my clients with one seat are getting 3-7 meetings/per week. I have a few clients who have scaled up with us that are achieving 10-20/meetings per week. I think Harbor Compliance is well positioned with a really compelling product so I’d imagine we’d be able to achieve above average meeting volume. At the end of the day, any number I give you is purely an estimate and arbitrary.	• Yes, but that is included in my costs. I will upgrade whatever profile you give us.
    • So, am I to understand that we'd be paying for a single "seat" to get at least 3-7 meetings per week? If we added additional "seats" would we be billed $7650 for each one we add? If that's the case, would adding two seats put us in the 6-14 meeting/week range? When you say "scaled up" how many seats do those clients have?	• Exactly. My most successful client who gets about 20 meetings a week is at 6 seats. Although, their business is much different and is not a perfect comparable.
    Do your reps require access to our CRM?
    This is completely up to you. We can create our own Salesforce and keep everything separate.
    Are we able to take what we learn from our engagement together and use it to train our own reps in the future even after the engagement has ended?
    
    Yes, you can. I’m prepared to be pretty transparent about our processes and systems. This is mainly to protect me from clients sharing information with my competitors. That I’m not comfortable with.
    
    
    
    Objection Handling:
    
    Straight NI: Are you still hiring for the (Job title) position?
    
    Objection #1: Where are you located?
    Answer: We are located in the United States.
    Headquarters: Washington, DC
    
    Objection #2: How did you get my number?
    Answer: “We have a contact info database that we use to find phone numbers.”
    
    If someone asks you, “which database?”
    “It’s called rocket reach.”
    
    If they continue to ask you more information about how you got their information
    “I really didn’t mean to bother you, I can just take you off our list.”
    
    
    Objection #4: I tried outsourcing before and haven’t had any success.
    Answer: I completely understand. We’ve actually worked with a lot of companies that have had unsuccessful engagements and campaigns with other lead generation companies. But all I can say is that we do things differently and have a very unique model that is different from any other lead generation or sales development you've worked with. We would love to walk you through exactly how we are different. Would you be interested in setting up a quick introductory call with us?
    
    Objection #5: Why should we work with you vs hiring a full time employee.
    Answer: Our biggest differentiator is that we hit a much higher volume across every activity that we do. 400-800 cold calls a day, 65 highly targeted prospected leads, huge amounts of reachout via emails, and linkedin. Hiring 1 person you get the volume of 1 person, with us you get the volume of up to 15 people a day.
    
    Objection #6: Do you have experience selling to [X] industry?
    Answer:
    -Absolutely! [Client List]
    -Yes, we work with firms across a diverse set of industry types including private equity, SaaS, agencies, healthcare, energy, real-estate. I think the best course of action is for me to schedule a meeting between you and my manager, who can talk more specifically about our experience about [X] industry.
    
    Objection #7: Where are your callers located?
    Answer: Our cold calling team is based in the United States and from around the world. If you were to work with us, you can choose where your cold caller is located. It can be international or you can work with US only cold callers. It's up to you on what you would prefer.
    
    Objection #8: I already hired someone/I already hired Sales Development reps or BDRs
    Answer: We work with many companies that have their own teams and sales development reps. We make them more efficient by handling repetitive tasks, so they can focus on account-based marketing and creative tasks.
    
    Objection #9: Outsourcing cost more
    Answer: Our services are typically commensurate with the cost of hiring internally. We would love to break it down actually on a call. Would you be interested in setting up a quick introductory call with us?
    
    Objection #11: We are still figuring out our strategy, who to target and what our messaging would be.
    Answer: One thing that makes us really unique from other lead generation and sales development companies is that we are McKinsey level consultants, and we can definitely help you craft that messaging and  strategy that you need. Another thing that would make us unique is that we do things at a very high volume across numerous channels and thousands and thousands of leads. Thus our sample size of data is much larger, which you can use to figure out who is responding as well as the right people to target. Rather than you guys figuring things out on your own,  we can essentially test the market at scale and help you craft that strategy. We would love to tell you more about how we can be helpful from a strategic consulting perspective.
    
    Objection #12: We are already using [X sales tool]
    Answer: We’re a full-service sales development consulting and lead generation company. We do high-volume cold calling, custom prospecting, and huge amounts of outreach via emails, SMS, and LinkedIn.
    Objection #13: Can you do a commission based model? Can you do a pay per lead model? Can you do a pay per meeting model?
    
    Answer: No,  we do not do pay  per lead/pay per meeting type of model. We are a full service consulting company and invest a significant amount in our clients, and offer strategic consulting at the front end. We would love to tell you more about how we are. Would you be open to learning more about us?
    
    Objection #14: We are looking for somebody that does more than that. (prospecting, cold calling and email marketing.)
    
    We saw on the job post that you are looking for somebody to also do prospecting, email marketing and cold calling as well. Those are some of the things and ways in which we can help. We would love to at least show you how we operate and how we can help you on those components of your need.
    Would you be open to learning more about us?
    
    Objection #15: We work with the government, I don't know if we can work with you.
    We have worked with government contractors and even with cybersecurity companies that work with government contractors, so we have plenty of experience working in that area.
    
    Objection #16: Lead wants to have callers that DOES NOT HAVE a foreign accent.
    "We have a hybrid model where the majority of our high-volume cold callers are based in the Philippines, but you will also have a U.S. Sales Associate assigned to your account that focuses on warm leads or chasing calls. Our team in the Philippines speaks very clear English, but you may notice an accent with some of the callers. We have found that the leads we call are more concerned with the value proposition and what our clients are offering, rather than focusing too much on the caller's accent."
    
    Objection #17: (Head of Company, CEO only) Referral to somebody lower Level
    Answer: I'll definitely reach out and send an email. Thank you for referring us to them. It's just that we were also hoping to introduce ourselves to you as we know that you lead the company. Ultimately, if we are going to do business together, you would have to sign off on it. So we were just also hoping to introduce ourselves to you. Would you be open to setting up a call as well?
    
    Objection #18 : Pricing question over the phone
    Answer: Our pricing ranges from $6500-$7500 per month
    
    Objection #19 : Are you a recruiter?/ Is this a recruitment firm?
    Answer: No, I'm not a recruiter. We're not a recruitment firm, we are actually a B2B lead generation firm and sometimes people think that we're recruiters because I'm referencing this job post that we saw on (job site) for an Account Executive. But the reason I'm actually referencing that job post is because we thought that you would be interested in our services to help this new account executive that you plan to hire. We would book them sales meetings for them to take and close deals from. That's what we do and that's why we are calling today to see if you'd be open to learning more about us.
