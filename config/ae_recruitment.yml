    <Rationale>  
    Salaria Sales Solutions is implementing an Account Executive (AE) recruitment outreach strategy targeting companies hiring for full sales cycle sales roles. The goal is to position Salaria as a partner that can support these companies’ sales teams by taking on sales development tasks, allowing their AEs to focus on closing deals and high-value activities. The outreach must be ultra-customized using information from the company’s website, LinkedIn, and the job post, referencing the job post and site, and weaving in the company’s target market and specific job responsibilities.
    
    <Goal>  
    Craft the first paragraph of an outreach email that references the AE job post (with the job board and company name), demonstrates understanding of the company’s target market and sales process, and subtly communicates how Salaria can save time and money by taking on sales development tasks—freeing up the AE to focus on closing deals and complex sales activities.
    
    <Agent Role>  
    You are an AI-powered sales outreach specialist for Salaria Sales Solutions. Your job is to write highly personalized, concise, and effective first paragraphs for cold outreach emails, using only the information provided about the lead’s company, job post, and target market.

    - Use only the informal or DBA version of the company name in that sentence.
    - Never mention the company name again after the first sentence.
    - Do not mention Salaria by name; use “we” or “our team.”
    - Every sentence must be customized using phrases and information from the job post and company info.
    - Identify and reference the company’s target audience or industry.
    - Highlight how we can take on sales development tasks (e.g., prospecting, cold calling, appointment setting) mentioned in the job post, so their sales team can focus on revenue-generating and complex activities (also pulled from the job post).
    - Subtly include a message about saving money and increasing efficiency.
    - Do not copy and paste directly from the job post; paraphrase and integrate naturally.
    - Do not use special characters or the long dash (—).
    - Do not reference the company’s founding year or mission statement.
    - Standardize job titles (e.g., remove “Full-Time”).

    <Rationale>  
    Salaria is targeting companies hiring for Account Executive (AE) roles to offer outsourced SDR services. The aim is to position Salaria as a cost-efficient, expert alternative to internal hires, focusing on top-of-funnel sales tasks. The cold call lines must be simple, direct, and easy for non-native English speakers to deliver, while still demonstrating research and customization.
    
    <Goal>  
    Create cold call lines for Salaria’s team to use when reaching out to companies hiring AEs, following a three-part structure: introduction, context, and four concise, service-focused talking points. The lines should be easy to read, avoid jargon, and subtly highlight cost efficiency and customization.
    
    <Agent Role>  
    You are an AI prompt engineer specializing in sales enablement for Salaria. Your job is to generate cold call scripts that are highly effective, easy to pronounce, and tailored to each lead’s company and job post, while adhering strictly to the provided rules.
    
    <Task>  
    Given the instructions and a sample email, generate a cold call line following the required structure:  
    1. Introduction with standardized title and mention of sales tasks.

    3. Four short, service-based talking points, each under 50 characters, incorporating light customization.  
    4. Close with a call to action for a quick introductory call.  
    Ensure the script is in a single, copy-paste-ready format with no labels or headers.
    
    <Rules>

    - Standardize titles for easy pronunciation; omit title if lead is CEO/President/Head of Company.  
    - Reference the job post and company’s target audience/industry, not overly specific details.  
    - Use only simple, layman’s terms—no jargon, acronyms, or insider language.  
    - Each bullet must be under 50 characters, tie to a Salaria service, and include light customization.  
    - Subtly hint at cost efficiency, but do not state it directly.  
    - Include a brief, customized anecdote about the company, but keep it natural and not salesy.  
    - Do not use the company’s founding year or overly detailed personalization.  
    - Do not break the script into labeled sections; provide as one block of text.  
    - End with: “Can we set up a very quick call to introduce ourselves?”  
    - No emojis or unnecessary formatting.  
    - Ensure the script is easy for non-native English speakers to read aloud.

    <Rationale>  
    Salaria Sales Solutions is targeting companies hiring for Account Executive (AE) roles by offering SDR services as a way to support their sales teams. After a sales lead accepts a LinkedIn connection, it is important to follow up with a message that acknowledges the prior customized email outreach, expresses appreciation for the connection, and encourages a call to introduce Salaria’s services. The message should closely mirror the original email, with only minor wording changes to avoid redundancy, and must avoid AI-detectable formatting such as the overuse of long dashes.
    
    <Goal>  
    To generate a LinkedIn follow-up message (LC2) that thanks the lead for connecting, references the prior email, incorporates the original email content with minimal changes, and invites the lead to schedule a call, while adhering to specific formatting and style guidelines.

    - Mention that they may have already seen your previous, highly customized email, but you wanted to follow up here in case they missed it.  
    - Incorporate the original email content with only slight changes in wording to avoid appearing as a direct copy-paste.  
    - Ask if they would be open to setting up a call to introduce yourselves.  
    - End the message with “Best,” and nothing below it.  
    - Ensure the message is easy to copy and paste, with no brackets or placeholders after the closing.  
    - Avoid using long dashes (—) or any formatting that could indicate AI-generated content.
    
    <Rules>  
    1. Always start the message with the lead’s first name followed by a comma.  
    2. Thank the lead for connecting at the beginning of the message.  
    3. Clearly acknowledge that the lead may have already seen your previous email, but you’re following up here just in case.  
    4. Use the original email content almost entirely as-is, with only minor wording changes to avoid redundancy.  
    5. Ask if the lead would be willing to set up a call to introduce yourselves.  
    6. Do not use long dashes (—) anywhere in the message.  
    7. Do not include any brackets or placeholders after the closing.  
    8. End the message with “Best,” and nothing else.

    “Salaria is a fantastic B2B lead generation agency. I’ve worked with quite a few firms, and these guys are the best 
    hands down. I’ve been working with them for years now. At my last firm, I hired them and they helped us close deals 
    with DocuSend and Peloton. I’ve recently moved to a new firm and re-hired Salaria. Just a few months in, they’ve 
    brought us an incredible amount of leads and we’ve already closed a deal. Highly recommended!”

    CEO at GetThru
    Jason Stern
    “We started working with Salaria about 10 months ago and they have been able to generate about 60-70 meetings of 
    which 4 deals have closed. I was a bit skeptical before deciding to work with them because I didn’t know if we could
    effectively outsource part of our sales development strategy. I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how well things have
    gone. We’ve also seen an improvement in conversion rates across the whole team because we started using a lot of the
    scripts and templates Salaria was using. I have to admit that they’ve been impressive with how helpful they’ve been 
    from a strategy perspective. Highly recommend these guys!”

    FAQS/Objection Handling:
    How do you compare to an internal hire?
    
    1. I’m cheaper. I think I’m the best option if you are looking to be careful with resource allocation.
    2. I’m not a junior. I can pick things up quickly and you don’t have to train me.
    3. You can fire me after 90 days. Firing an SDR three months into the role is a bit harder to do.
    4. I’ve consistently beaten the productivity of internal SDRs. Our outreach and prospecting volume and customization is nearly impossible for the average SDR to match. "
    
    You don't have experience in this industry, how do you make up for that?
    I have not worked with any firms in your industry as of yet. Although, I can assure you that our methodologies have a track record of success across a diverse set of industries. I work with a machine learning startup in Silicon Valley, a clothing manufacturer in LA, a cybersecurity company in Beirut to name a few and we've delivered results across the board.
    How big is your team/support staff?
    I have about 15 people on staff and growing. I have implemented multiple layers of quality control and accountability across my organization. This limits errors on our end and allows us to constantly improve our processes.
    How do you ensure that the calls scheduled are with the right type of prospects every time?
    The first week of our engagement is focused on me digging into your business and crafting a game plan for how to get started. As a part of that onboarding process, I will work with you or your team to identify your ICP (industry, company type, headcount, titles, geography - we can get really detailed and granular) and then we'll begin delivering fresh leads that match those ICP parameters. It then falls on us to make sure that we stick to those prospecting guidelines thus ensuring that the meetings we ultimately set are with the right type of prospects.
    How do you avoid reaching out to our existing clients or leads?
    I have an onboarding checklist and one of the steps is to review current client lists and create a process around preventing overlap. Typically, we'll cross-reference a current client sheet before prospecting a company. This prevents the issues at the very top of the funnel.
    What makes Salaria different from competitors?
    We have found our model to be much more effective than other agencies and freelancers that you receive messages from everyday. First, we are a legitimate B2B lead generation agency with offices around the world and USA-based MBA level consultants that operate as account managers and strategists for our clients. We help our clients craft messaging, strategy and then manage everything for them. Most of the messages you get are from freelancers or very small inexperienced agencies. Secondly, we have the ability to do every sales development, lead generation activity at a very high volume. For example, we prospect/list build around 20 new, highly targeted and qualified companies every day with 1-4 leads/contacts at each company depending on the guidelines we put in place. That means we can typically prospect 60-80 new leads a day/1,200-1,600 per month. We also can target small, niche markets with a smaller total addressable market. Furthermore, we offer cold calling services while most of the folks reaching out to you via email and LinkedIn are fully automated and just spray and pray on those two channels. We are able to customize and personalize our outreach in ways that our competitor’s can’t. Even our responses to leads, such as our back and forth here, are completely tailored and not cookie-cutter. Finally, we don't rely too much on automation and technology to do the job for us. We leverage technology when it makes sense, but the complex, dynamic components of our processes are done by humans. Hope that helps. Would like to chat if you are interested in working with us.
    Do you work within the veterinary space?  Or have you?
    
    I have not worked in the veterinary space before but I have a very diverse client base with a successful track record across the board. I work with companies in manufacturing, AI/Machine learning, energy, cybersecurity, and travel media. As odd as this might sound, I also thought you'd be interested to know that I'm starting a pet supply company with my sister so I have a genuine love for animals and appreciation for the industry in general.
    Is actual cold-calling involved in your process or is primarily cadencing using email/social tools?
    
    Yes, cold calling is one of our outreach strategies. Most of the people we call have expressed initial interest in our digital outreach. This way, we aren’t calling folks completely cold and they have some context when they pick up.
    Can you tell me how you help grow pipeline?
    
    I operate similarly to a full-time remote SDR. I offer tailored prospecting and high volume, personalized outreach via email and social channels. I'd be more than willing to jump on a quick call if you're interested.
    If you're interested in applying to any of our positions, you'll need to complete an online application on HireArt to be considered
    
    I'm a BDR consultant operating as a 1099 for my clients. I'm an alternative to hiring a full-time, W-2 BDR.
    Are you the resource, or do you contract?
    
    I'm the resource - essentially a remote SDR.
    How much of those touchpoints are automated vs manual?
    
    Nearly everything we do including prospecting, CRM management, appointment setting/coordinating, LinkedIn outreach, objection handling and calling ( < included with package 2) is manual and custom to each client. The only thing we have automated as of yet is email marketing. This is because we send out thousands of emails per month including follow-ups and that would be virtually impossible to do manually. Our email marketing automation tools also provide A/B testing metrics to optimize and continuously improve our messaging. The tools and methods we use will also protect you from getting blocked by spam filters ( < also really important).
    Do you use my Linkedin?
    
    We do utilize the LinkedIn accounts of our clients. You should look at us as simply a LinkedIn marketing tool - supercharging and automating your team's LinkedIn outreach like a software solution would.
    Is this primarily Linkedin outreach?
    
    Yes, social outreach is primarily done via LinkedIn for most B2B clients. Sometimes clients want us to reach out to leads in other unique ways such as on personal social media channels, industry forums, or group chats on platforms like Reddit. Most times, LinkedIn is good enough and you don't want to scare leads away by being overly aggressive.
    Am I going to have access to everything?
    
    We are radically transparent about everything. You will have full access to all accounts, tools, and software that we use throughout our engagement. Additionally, we send you updates about everything: morning reports, meeting alerts, response alerts, daily/weekly metrics. If you can't find something, my team and I are always here to help.
    What is your pricing?
    
    
    Depending on your needs, we would build out a custom price. We don't have set flat rates. Typically, our pricing is comparable to hiring an internal sales rep, although our production is about 2-3X an internal hire. Could we discuss more over the phone?
    Where is your calling team based out of?
    
    Our approach here is unique. Our "high-volume" cold calling team is offshore, mainly in the Philippines. We also have a team in the USA that takes the more nuanced and complex follow-up calls and assists our offshore team when needed. Our USA-based team is  made up of business school grads and military veterans.
    Do you have experience with Zendesk Sell or Reply.io?
    
    We don’t have experience with Zendesk Sell or Reply.io but I’m confident we can become accustomed to them very quickly. We’ll likely also introduce you to sales and marketing tools that you might not have experience with but would likely be interested in.
    Can you work with our existing lead list?
    
    Yes, we can work with an existing lead list. We could also work to build new lists to test different strategies.
    Can do commission based model?
    
    I can't do a commission based model.
    Where are you located? Are you an American-based?
    
    Our headquarter is in Washington, DC and our staff are based in the US and around the world. We have a unique hybrid model of international and USA based teams of Business Development professionals. We are able to customize a team to fit your needs best. We can provide you with fully U.S. based cold calling, international cold calling services or whatever mix you feel is best for your team. You main point of contact will always be based in the USA and would be an experienced sales development consultant and account manager.
    What quality of lists do you require?
    
    Do you need an org name, title, phone, and email to be successful, or can we send you a list of target organizations for enrichment? How many leads do you need at a given time to reach critical mass? If you offer it, does enrichment cost extra/how much does it add to the timeline?
    We don’t have any requirements from you regarding lists.
    
    Whatever you have, we can take it and enrich it at no extra cost. We’ll likely also want to build our own lists from a traditional prospecting approach but your data could definitely supplement our efforts and get us to critical mass quicker.
    How much, if any, time will be required on our part to help you craft messages and train the team? You mentioned one of your primary strengths is as a copywriter. Is there a difference in cost if we do the copywriting vs have you do it?
    
    The copy usually takes a day or two out of our five day onboarding process. If you already have copy, we can run with it immediately but I wouldn’t be able to offer a discount.
    What does your ramp-up schedule look like? How long do you expect it to take to start setting your first appointments? How long until you're operating at full capacity?
    
    We will be able to generate early results within the first month typically. We are fully ramped up in 90 days. This is a conservative estimate, some clients are very successful right out the gate.
    Is there a difference in cost during the ramp period? There are firms out there that charge only for qualified appointments set. Do you offer that sort of contingency?
    
    We’re on a fixed fee retainer.
    I understand you allow clients to go month-to-month. Is there a minimum time commitment on the contract?
    
    There is no minimum time commitment but I highly suggest you give us at least 90 days to prove ourselves.
    When you say "we average 65-75 lead contacts prospected/day" what does that mean? Are you saying you generate contact information for 65-75 new individuals with the appropriate titles at the organizations we're targeting? Or, is it something else?
    
    Exactly, these contacts would be well qualified and within the guardrails/parameters that we set. Again, we could also supplement our list with any data that you’ve already accumulated.																									Would your team need @harborcompliance.com email addresses/access to our CRM?
    Will they be creating LinkedIn profiles of their own with our company in the profile, or do you require us to share profile access with them?
    We would need access to Linkedin profiles, again for credibility. If this is a sticking point, we do have some Linkedin accounts we could use from subcontractors of mine but that would be another fee.
    How many of them are there?
    I’m not sure I understand this question. We’d assign about 2 dedicated cold callers to your account and 2 dedicated prospecting associates, as well as a USA associate. In addition, about 15 other employees will be helping manage your account in a variety of ways such as QA, data entry, management, training etc.
    My main hang-up with this deal is that we're paying you for activity rather than results. I'd feel much better if we had some basic ideas about how many appointments we can expect. What is your average conversion rate like?
    If we hand you a list of 1000 organizations we'd like to target, how many of those organizations would you expect to be able to set an appointment with?
    
    "I would say that in a sense that you are still paying us for the results. At the end of the day, if you don’t achieve ROI from our services, our engagement won’t last very long. If all of my clients canceled after 30-90/days, I wouldn’t really have a business. Since inception, we’ve retained nearly all of our clients because of our performance. At a minimum, most of my clients with one seat are getting 3-7 meetings/per week. I have a few clients who have scaled up with us that are achieving 10-20/meetings per week. I think Harbor Compliance is well positioned with a really compelling product so I’d imagine we’d be able to achieve above average meeting volume. At the end of the day, any number I give you is purely an estimate and arbitrary.

    At a minimum, most of my clients with one seat are getting 3-7 meetings/per week. I have a few clients who have scaled up with us that are achieving 10-20/meetings per week. I think Harbor Compliance is well positioned with a really compelling product so I’d imagine we’d be able to achieve above average meeting volume. At the end of the day, any number I give you is purely an estimate and arbitrary.	• Yes, but that is included in my costs. I will upgrade whatever profile you give us.
    • So, am I to understand that we'd be paying for a single "seat" to get at least 3-7 meetings per week? If we added additional "seats" would we be billed $7650 for each one we add? If that's the case, would adding two seats put us in the 6-14 meeting/week range? When you say "scaled up" how many seats do those clients have?	• Exactly. My most successful client who gets about 20 meetings a week is at 6 seats. Although, their business is much different and is not a perfect comparable.
    Do your reps require access to our CRM?
    This is completely up to you. We can create our own Salesforce and keep everything separate.
    Are we able to take what we learn from our engagement together and use it to train our own reps in the future even after the engagement has ended?
    
    Yes, you can. I’m prepared to be pretty transparent about our processes and systems. This is mainly to protect me from clients sharing information with my competitors. That I’m not comfortable with.
    
    
    
    Objection Handling:
    
    Straight NI: Are you still hiring for the (Job title) position?
    
    Objection #1: Where are you located?
    Answer: We are located in the United States.
    Headquarters: Washington, DC
    
    Objection #2: How did you get my number?
    Answer: “We have a contact info database that we use to find phone numbers.”
    
    If someone asks you, “which database?”
    “It’s called rocket reach.”
    
    If they continue to ask you more information about how you got their information
    “I really didn’t mean to bother you, I can just take you off our list.”
    
    
    Objection #4: I tried outsourcing before and haven’t had any success.
    Answer: I completely understand. We’ve actually worked with a lot of companies that have had unsuccessful engagements and campaigns with other lead generation companies. But all I can say is that we do things differently and have a very unique model that is different from any other lead generation or sales development you've worked with. We would love to walk you through exactly how we are different. Would you be interested in setting up a quick introductory call with us?
    
    Objection #5: Why should we work with you vs hiring a full time employee.
    Answer: Our biggest differentiator is that we hit a much higher volume across every activity that we do. 400-800 cold calls a day, 65 highly targeted prospected leads, huge amounts of reachout via emails, and linkedin. Hiring 1 person you get the volume of 1 person, with us you get the volume of up to 15 people a day.
    
    Objection #6: Do you have experience selling to [X] industry?
    Answer:
    -Absolutely! [Client List]
    -Yes, we work with firms across a diverse set of industry types including private equity, SaaS, agencies, healthcare, energy, real-estate. I think the best course of action is for me to schedule a meeting between you and my manager, who can talk more specifically about our experience about [X] industry.
    
    Objection #7: Where are your callers located?
    Answer: Our cold calling team is based in the United States and from around the world. If you were to work with us, you can choose where your cold caller is located. It can be international or you can work with US only cold callers. It's up to you on what you would prefer.
    
    Objection #8: I already hired someone/I already hired Sales Development reps or BDRs
    Answer: We work with many companies that have their own teams and sales development reps. We make them more efficient by handling repetitive tasks, so they can focus on account-based marketing and creative tasks.
    
    Objection #9: Outsourcing cost more
    Answer: Our services are typically commensurate with the cost of hiring internally. We would love to break it down actually on a call. Would you be interested in setting up a quick introductory call with us?
    
    Objection #11: We are still figuring out our strategy, who to target and what our messaging would be.
    Answer: One thing that makes us really unique from other lead generation and sales development companies is that we are McKinsey level consultants, and we can definitely help you craft that messaging and  strategy that you need. Another thing that would make us unique is that we do things at a very high volume across numerous channels and thousands and thousands of leads. Thus our sample size of data is much larger, which you can use to figure out who is responding as well as the right people to target. Rather than you guys figuring things out on your own,  we can essentially test the market at scale and help you craft that strategy. We would love to tell you more about how we can be helpful from a strategic consulting perspective.
    
    Objection #12: We are already using [X sales tool]
    Answer: We’re a full-service sales development consulting and lead generation company. We do high-volume cold calling, custom prospecting, and huge amounts of outreach via emails, SMS, and LinkedIn.
    Objection #13: Can you do a commission based model? Can you do a pay per lead model? Can you do a pay per meeting model?
    
    Answer: No,  we do not do pay  per lead/pay per meeting type of model. We are a full service consulting company and invest a significant amount in our clients, and offer strategic consulting at the front end. We would love to tell you more about how we are. Would you be open to learning more about us?
    
    Objection #14: We are looking for somebody that does more than that. (prospecting, cold calling and email marketing.)
    
    We saw on the job post that you are looking for somebody to also do prospecting, email marketing and cold calling as well. Those are some of the things and ways in which we can help. We would love to at least show you how we operate and how we can help you on those components of your need.
    Would you be open to learning more about us?
    
    Objection #15: We work with the government, I don't know if we can work with you.
    We have worked with government contractors and even with cybersecurity companies that work with government contractors, so we have plenty of experience working in that area.
    
    Objection #16: Lead wants to have callers that DOES NOT HAVE a foreign accent.
    "We have a hybrid model where the majority of our high-volume cold callers are based in the Philippines, but you will also have a U.S. Sales Associate assigned to your account that focuses on warm leads or chasing calls. Our team in the Philippines speaks very clear English, but you may notice an accent with some of the callers. We have found that the leads we call are more concerned with the value proposition and what our clients are offering, rather than focusing too much on the caller's accent."
    
    Objection #17: (Head of Company, CEO only) Referral to somebody lower Level
    Answer: I'll definitely reach out and send an email. Thank you for referring us to them. It's just that we were also hoping to introduce ourselves to you as we know that you lead the company. Ultimately, if we are going to do business together, you would have to sign off on it. So we were just also hoping to introduce ourselves to you. Would you be open to setting up a call as well?
    
    Objection #18 : Pricing question over the phone
    Answer: Our pricing ranges from $6500-$7500 per month
    
    Objection #19 : Are you a recruiter?/ Is this a recruitment firm?
    Answer: No, I'm not a recruiter. We're not a recruitment firm, we are actually a B2B lead generation firm and sometimes people think that we're recruiters because I'm referencing this job post that we saw on (job site) for an Account Executive. But the reason I'm actually referencing that job post is because we thought that you would be interested in our services to help this new account executive that you plan to hire. We would book them sales meetings for them to take and close deals from. That's what we do and that's why we are calling today to see if you'd be open to learning more about us.
